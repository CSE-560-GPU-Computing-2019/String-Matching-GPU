            except as provided in such Annex or Chapter. 
 
 
                             Section A - National Treatment 
 
 
            Article 301:   National Treatment 
 
            1.   Each Party shall accord national treatment to the goods of 
            another Party in accordance with Article III of the General 
            Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), including its 
            interpretative notes, and to this end Article III of the GATT 
            and its interpretative notes, or any equivalent provision of a 
            successor agreement to which all Parties are party, are 
            incorporated into and made part of this Agreement. 
 
            2.   The provisions of paragraph 1 regarding national treatment 
            shall mean, with respect to a state or province, treatment no 
            less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded by 
            such state or province to any like, directly competitive or 
            substitutable goods, as the case may be, of the Party of which 
            it forms a part. 
 
            3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply to the measures set out in

            in their Schedules.  An agreement between two or more Parties 
            to accelerate the elimination of a customs duty on a good shall 
            supersede any duty rate or staging category determined pursuant 
            to their Schedules for such good when approved by each such 
            Party in accordance with its applicable legal procedures. 
 
            4.   Each Party may adopt or maintain import measures to 
            allocate in-quota imports made pursuant to a tariff rate quota 
            set out in Annex 302.2, provided that such measures do not have 
            trade restrictive effects on imports additional to those caused 
            by the imposition of the tariff rate quota. 
 
            5.   On written request of any Party, a Party applying or 
            intending to apply measures pursuant to paragraph 4 shall 
            consult to review the administration of those measures. 
 
 
            Article 303:   Restriction on Drawback and Duty Deferral 
                           Programs 
 
            1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Article, no Party may 
            refund the amount of customs duties paid, or waive or reduce 
            the amount of customs duties owed, on a good imported into its 
            territory, on condition that the good is: 
 
                 (a)  subsequently exported to the territory of another 
                      Party, 
 
                 (b)  used as a material in the production of another good 
                      that is subsequently exported to the territory of 
                      another Party, or 
 
                 (c)  substituted by an identical or similar good used as a 
                      material in the production of another good that is 
                      subsequently exported to the territory of another 
                      Party, 
 
            in an amount that exceeds the lesser of the total amount of 
            customs duties paid or owed on the good on importation into its 
            territory and the total amount of customs duties paid to 
            another Party on the good that has been subsequently exported 
            to the territory of that other Party. 
 
            2.   No Party may, on condition of export, refund, waive or 
            reduce: 
 
                 (a)  an antidumping or countervailing duty that is applied 
                      pursuant to a Party's domestic law and that is not 
                      applied inconsistently with Chapter Nineteen (Review 
                      and Dispute Settlement in Antidumping and 
                      Countervailing Duty Matters); 
 
                 (b)  a premium offered or collected on an imported good 
                      arising out of any tendering system in respect of the 
                      administration of quantitative import restrictions, 
                      tariff rate quotas or tariff preference levels; 
 
                 (c)  a fee applied pursuant to section 22 of the U.S. 
                      Agricultural Adjustment Act, subject to Chapter Seven 
                      (Agriculture and Sanitary and Phytosanitary 
                      Measures); or 
 
                 (d)  customs duties paid or owed on a good imported into 
                      its territory and substituted by an identical or 
                      similar good that is subsequently exported to the 
                      territory of another Party. 
 
            3.   Where a good is imported into the territory of a Party 
            pursuant to a duty deferral program and is subsequently 
            exported to the territory of another Party, or is used as a 
            material in the production of another good that is subsequently 
            exported to the territory of another Party, or is substituted 
            by an identical or similar good used as a material in the 
            production of another good that is subsequently exported to the 
            territory of another Party, the Party from whose territory the 
            good is exported: 
 
                 (a)  shall assess the customs duties as if the exported 
                      good had been withdrawn for domestic consumption; and 
 
                 (b)  may waive or reduce such customs duties to the extent 
                      permitted under paragraph 1. 
 
            4.   In determining the amount of customs duties that may be 
            refunded, waived or reduced pursuant to paragraph 1 on a good 
            imported into its territory, each Party shall require 
            presentation of satisfactory evidence of the amount of customs 
            duties paid to another Party on the good that has been 
            subsequently exported to the territory of that other Party. 
 
            5.   Where satisfactory evidence of the customs duties paid to 
            the Party to which a good is subsequently exported under a duty 
            deferral program described in paragraph 3 is not presented 
            within 60 days after the date of exportation, the Party from 
            whose territory the good was exported: 
 
                 (a)  shall collect customs duties as if the exported good 
                      had been withdrawn for domestic consumption; and 
 
                 (b)  may refund such customs duties to the extent 
                      permitted under paragraph 1 on the timely 
                      presentation of such evidence under its laws and 
                      regulations. 
 
            6.   This Article does not apply to: 
 
                 (a)  a good entered under bond for transportation and 
                      exportation to the territory of another Party; 
 
                 (b)  a good exported to the territory of another Party in 
                      the same condition as when imported into the 
                      territory of the Party from which the good was 
                      exported (processes such as testing, cleaning, 
                      repacking or inspecting the good, or preserving it in 
                      its same condition, shall not be considered to change 
                      a good's condition).  Except as provided in Annex 
                      703.2, Section A, paragraph 12, where such a good has 
                      been commingled with fungible goods and exported in 
                      the same condition, its origin for purposes of this 
                      subparagraph, may be determined on the basis of the 
                      inventory methods provided for in the Uniform 
                      Regulations established under Article 511 (Uniform 
                      Regulations); 
 
                 (c)  a good imported into the territory of a Party that is 
                      deemed to be exported from its territory, or used as 
                      a material in the production of another good that is 
                      deemed to be exported to the territory of another 
                      Party, or is substituted by an identical or similar 
                      good used as a material in the production of another 
                      good that is deemed to be exported to the territory 
                      of another Party, by reason of 
 
                      (i)  delivery to a duty-free shop, 
 
                      (ii) delivery for ship's stores or supplies for ships 
                           or aircraft, or 
 
                      (iii)     delivery for use in joint undertakings of 
                                two or more of the Parties and that will 
                                subsequently become the property of the 
                                Party into whose territory the good was 
                                imported; 
 
                 (d)  a refund of customs duties by a Party on a particular 
                      good imported into its territory and subsequently 
                      exported to the territory of another Party, where 
                      that refund is granted by reason of the failure of 
                      such good to conform to sample or specification, or 
                      by reason of the shipment of such good without the 
                      consent of the consignee; 
 
                 (e)  an originating good that is imported into the 
                      territory of a Party and is subsequently exported to 
                      the territory of another Party, or used as a material 
                      in the production of another good that is 
                      subsequently exported to the territory of another 
                      Party, or is substituted by an identical or similar 
                      good used as a material in the production of another 
                      good that is subsequently exported to the territory 
                      of another Party; or 
 
                 (f)  a good set out in Annex 303.6. 
 
            7.   Except for paragraph 2(d), this Article shall apply as of 
            the date set out in each Party's Section of Annex 303.7. 
 
            8.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article and 
            except as specifically provided in Annex 303.8, no Party may 
            refund the amount of customs duties paid, or waive or reduce 
            the amount of customs duties owed, on a non-originating good 
            provided for in item 8540.11.aa (color cathode-ray television 
            picture tubes, including video monitor tubes, with a diagonal 
            exceeding 14 inches) or 8540.11.cc (color cathode-ray 
            television picture tubes for high definition television, with a 
            diagonal exceeding 14 inches) that is imported into the Party's 
            territory and subsequently exported to the territory of another 
            Party, or is used as a material in the production of another 
            good that is subsequently exported to the territory of another 
            Party, or is substituted by an identical or similar good used 
            as a material in the production of another good that is 
            subsequently exported to the territory of another Party. 
 
            9.   For purposes of this Article: 
 
            customs duties are the customs duties that would be applicable 
            to a good entered for consumption in the customs territory of a 
            Party if the good were not exported to the territory of another 
            party; 
 
            identical or similar goods means "identical or similar goods" 
            as defined in Article 415 (Rules of Origin - Definitions); 
 
            material means "material" as defined in Article 415;  
 
            used means "used" as defined in Article 415; and 
            where a good referred to by a tariff item number in this 
            Article is described in parentheses following the tariff item 
            number, the description is provided for purposes of reference 
            only. 
 
 
            Article 304:   Waiver of Customs Duties 
 
            1.   Except as set out in Annex 304.1, no Party may adopt any 
            new waiver of customs duties, or expand with respect to 
            existing recipients or extend to any new recipient the 
            application of an existing waiver of customs duties, where the 
            waiver is conditioned, explicitly or implicitly, on the 
            fulfillment of a performance requirement. 
 
            2.   Except as set out in Annex 304.2, no Party may, explicitly 
            or implicitly, condition on the fulfillment of a performance 
            requirement the continuation of any existing waiver of customs 
            duties. 
 
            3.   If a waiver or a combination of waivers of customs duties 
            granted by a Party with respect to goods for commercial use by 
            a designated person can be shown by another Party to have an 
            adverse impact on the commercial interests of a person of that 
            Party, or of a person owned or controlled by a person of that 
            Party that is located in the territory of the Party granting 
            the waiver, or on the other Party's economy, the Party granting 
            the waiver shall either cease to grant it or make it generally 
            available to any importer. 
 
            4.   This Article shall not apply to measures subject to 
            Article 303. 
 
 
            Article 305:   Temporary Admission of Goods 
 
            1.   Each Party shall grant duty-free temporary admission for: 
 
                 (a)  professional equipment necessary for carrying out the 
                      business activity, trade or profession of a business 
                      person who qualifies for temporary entry pursuant to 
                      Chapter Sixteen (Temporary Entry for Business 
                      Persons), 
 
                 (b)  equipment for the press or for sound or television 
                      broadcasting and cinematographic equipment, 
 
                 (c)  goods imported for sports purposes and goods intended 
                      for display or demonstration, and 
 
                 (d)  commercial samples and advertising films, 
 
            imported from the territory of another Party, regardless of 
            their origin and regardless of whether like, directly 
            competitive or substitutable goods are available in the 
            territory of the Party. 
 
            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Party 
            may condition the duty-free temporary admission of a good 
            referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c), other than to 
            require that such good: 
 
                 (a)  be imported by a national or resident of another 
                      Party who seeks temporary entry; 
 
                 (b)  be used solely by or under the personal supervision 
                      of such person in the exercise of the business 
                      activity, trade or profession of that person; 
 
                 (c)  not be sold or leased while in its territory; 
 
                 (d)  be accompanied by a bond in an amount no greater than 
                      110 percent of the charges that would otherwise be 
                      owed on entry or final importation, or by another 
                      form of security, releasable on exportation of the 
                      good, except that a bond for customs duties shall not 
                      be required for an originating good; 
 
                 (e)  be capable of identification when exported; 
 
                 (f)  be exported on the departure of that person or within 
                      such other period of time as is reasonably related to 
                      the purpose of the temporary admission; and 
 
                 (g)  be imported in no greater quantity than is reasonable 
                      for its intended use. 
 
            3.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Party 
            may condition the duty-free temporary admission of a good 
            referred to in paragraph 1(d), other than to require that such 
            good: 
 
                 (a)  be imported solely for the solicitation of orders for 
                      goods, or services provided from the territory, of 
                      another Party or non-Party; 
 
                 (b)  not be sold, leased or put to any use other than 
                      exhibition or demonstration while in its territory; 
 
                 (c)  be capable of identification when exported; 
 
                 (d)  be exported within such period as is reasonably 
                      related to the purpose of the temporary admission; 
                      and 
 
                 (e)  be imported in no greater quantity than is reasonable 
                      for its intended use. 
 
            4.   A Party may impose the customs duty and any other charge 
            on a good temporarily admitted duty-free under paragraph 1 that 
            would be owed on entry or final importation of such good if any 
            condition that the Party imposes under paragraph 2 or 3 has not 
            been fulfilled. 
 
            5.   Subject to Chapters Eleven (Investment) and Twelve (Cross- 
            Border Trade in Services): 
 
                 (a)  each Party shall allow a vehicle or container used in 
                      international traffic that enters its territory from 
                      the territory of another Party to exit its territory 
                      on any route that is reasonably related to the 
                      economic and prompt departure of such vehicle or 
                      container; 
 
                 (b)  no Party may require any bond or impose any penalty 
                      or charge solely by reason of any difference between 
                      the port of entry and the port of departure of a 
                      vehicle or container; 
 
                 (c)  no Party may condition the release of any obligation, 
                      including any bond, that it imposes in respect of the 
                      entry of a vehicle or container into its territory on 
                      its exit through any particular port of departure; 
                      and 
 
                 (d)  no Party may require that the vehicle or carrier 
                      bringing a container from the territory of another 
                      Party into its territory be the same vehicle or 
                      carrier that takes such container to the territory of 
                      another Party. 
 
            6.   For purposes of paragraph 5, "vehicle" means a truck, a 
            truck tractor, tractor, trailer unit or trailer, a locomotive, 
            or a railway car or other railroad equipment.

                           and Printed Advertising Materials 
 
                 Each Party shall grant duty-free entry to commercial 
            samples of negligible value, and to printed advertising 
            materials, imported from the territory of another Party, 
            regardless of their origin, but may require that:

            could be performed in its territory. 
 
            2.   Notwithstanding Article 303, no Party may apply a customs

            Article 309:   Import and Export Restrictions 
 
            1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Party 
            may adopt or maintain any prohibition or restriction on the 
            importation of any good of another Party or on the exportation 
            or sale for export of any good destined for the territory of 
            another Party, except in accordance with Article XI of the 
            GATT, including its interpretative notes, and to this end 
            Article XI of the GATT and its interpretative notes, or any 
            equivalent provision of a successor agreement to which all 
            Parties are party, are incorporated into and made a part of 
            this Agreement. 
 
            2.   The Parties understand that the GATT rights and 
            obligations incorporated by paragraph 1 prohibit, in any 
            circumstances in which any other form of restriction is 
            prohibited, export price requirements and, except as permitted 
            in enforcement of countervailing and antidumping orders and 
            undertakings, import price requirements. 
 
            3.   In the event that a Party adopts or maintains a 
            prohibition or restriction on the importation from or 
            exportation to a non-Party of a good, nothing in this Agreement 
            shall be construed to prevent the Party from: 
 
                 (a)  limiting or prohibiting the importation from the 
                      territory of another Party of such good of that non- 
                      Party; or 
 
                 (b)  requiring as a condition of export of such good of 
                      the Party to the territory of another Party, that the 
                      good not be re-exported to the non-Party, directly or 
                      indirectly, without being consumed in the territory 
                      of the other Party. 
 
            4.   In the event that a Party adopts or maintains a 
            prohibition or restriction on the importation of a good from a 
            non-Party, the Parties, on request of any Party, shall consult 
            with a view to avoiding undue interference with or distortion 
            of pricing, marketing and distribution arrangements in another 
            Party.

            distilled spirits imported from the territory of another Party 
            for bottling be blended with any distilled spirits of the 
            Party. 
 
            2.   Annex 312.2 applies to other measures relating to wine and 
            distilled spirits. 
 
 
            Article 313:   Distinctive Products

            Article 314:   Export Taxes 
 
                 Except as set out in Annex 314, no Party may adopt or 
            maintain any duty, tax or other charge on the export of any 
            good to the territory of another Party, unless such duty, tax 
            or charge is adopted or maintained on: 
 
                 (a)  exports of any such good to the territory of all 
                      other Parties; and

            Article 315:   Other Export Measures 
 
            1.   Except as set out in Annex 315, a Party may adopt or 
            maintain a restriction otherwise justified under Articles 
            XI:2(a) or XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT with respect to the 
            export of a good of the Party to the territory of another 
            Party, only if: 
 
                 (a)  the restriction does not reduce the proportion of the 
                      total export shipments of the specific good made 
                      available to that other Party relative to the total 
                      supply of that good of the Party maintaining the 
                      restriction as compared to the proportion prevailing 
                      in the most recent 36-month period for which data are 
                      available prior to the imposition of the measure, or 
                      in such other representative period on which the 
                      Parties may agree; 
 
                 (b)  the Party does not impose a higher price for exports 
                      of a good to that other Party than the price charged 
                      for such good when consumed domestically, by means of 
                      any measure, such as licenses, fees, taxation and 
                      minimum price requirements.  The foregoing provision 
                      does not apply to a higher price that may result from 
                      a measure taken pursuant to subparagraph (a) that 
                      only restricts the volume of exports; and 
 
                 (c)  the restriction does not require the disruption of 
                      normal channels of supply to that other Party or 
                      normal proportions among specific goods or categories 
                      of goods supplied to that other Party.

            development of effective controls on the export of each other's 
            goods to a non-Party in implementing this Article. 
 
 
                              Section D  -  Consultations 
 
 
            Article 316:   Consultations and Committee on Trade in Goods 
 
            1.   The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Trade in 
            Goods, comprising representatives of each Party.

            Chapter.

            border inspection facilities, and regulation of transportation 
            for the purpose of addressing issues related to movement of 
            goods through the Parties' ports of entry. 
 
 
            Article 317:   Third-Country Dumping

            Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on 
            Tariffs and Trade. 
 
            2.   Where a Party presents an application to another Party 
            requesting antidumping action on its behalf, those Parties 
            shall consult within 30 days respecting the factual basis of 
            the request, and the requested Party shall give full 
            consideration to the request.

            item in Column I of its Schedule to this Annex to an 
            originating good provided that: 
 
                 (a)  notwithstanding any provision in Chapter Four, in

                 on Certain Color Cathode-Ray Television Picture Tubes 
 
 
            1.   Any Party considering the reduction of its most-favored- 
            nation rate of customs duty for goods provided for in item 
            8540.11.aa (color cathode-ray television picture tubes, 
            including video monitor cathode-ray tubes, with a diagonal 
            exceeding 14 inches) or 8540.11.cc (color cathode-ray 
            television picture tubes for high definition television, with a 
            diagonal exceeding 14 inches) during the first 10 years after 
            the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall consult 
            with the other Parties in advance of such reduction. 
 
            2.   If any other Party objects in writing to such reduction, 
            other than a reduction in the Uruguay Round of Multilateral 
            Trade Negotiations, and the Party proceeds with the reduction, 
            any objecting Party may raise its applicable rate of duty on 
            originating goods provided for in the corresponding tariff item 
            set out in its Schedule to Annex 302.2, up to the applicable 
            rate of duty as if such good had been placed in staging 
            category C for purpose of tariff elimination.

                 To facilitate the operation of Article 308(3), the Parties 
            shall consult regarding the tariff classification of local area 
            network apparatus and shall endeavor to agree, no later than 
            January 1, 1994, on the classification of such goods in each 
            Party's tariff schedule.

                                   Section A - Mexico 
 
                 Mexico shall not increase its customs processing fee 
            ("derechos de tr mite aduanero") on originating goods, and 
            shall eliminate such fee on originating goods by June 30, 1999. 
 
 
                               Section B - United States 
 
            1.   The United States shall not increase its merchandise 
            processing fee and shall eliminate such fee according to the 
            schedule set out in Article 403 of the Canada - United States 
            Free Trade Agreement on originating goods where those goods 
            qualify to be marked as goods of Canada pursuant to Annex 311, 
            without regard to whether the goods are marked. 
 
            2.   The United States shall not increase its merchandise 
            processing fee and shall eliminate such fee by June 30, 1999, 
            on originating goods where those goods qualify to be marked as 
            goods of Mexico pursuant to Annex 311, without regard to 
            whether the goods are marked. 
 
                                       Annex 311 
 
                               Country of Origin Marking 
 
 
            1.   The Parties shall establish by January 1, 1994, rules for 
            determining whether a good is a good of a Party ("Marking 
            Rules") for purposes of this Annex, Annex 300-B and Annex 
            302.2, and for such other purposes as the Parties may agree. 
 
            2.   Each Party may require that a good of another Party, as 
            determined in accordance with the Marking Rules, bear a country 
            of origin marking, when imported into its territory, that 
            indicates to the ultimate purchaser of that good the name of 
            its country of origin. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall permit the country of origin marking of a 
            good of another Party to be indicated in English, French or 
            Spanish, except that a Party may, as part of its general 
            consumer information measures, require that an imported good be 
            marked with its country of origin in the same manner as 
            prescribed for goods of that Party. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall, in adopting, maintaining and applying 
            any measure relating to country of origin marking, minimize the 
            difficulties, costs and inconveniences that the measure may 
            cause to the commerce and industry of the other Parties. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall: 
 
                 (a)  accept any reasonable method of marking of a good of 
                      another Party, including the use of stickers, labels, 
                      tags or paint, that ensures that the marking is 
                      conspicuous, legible and sufficiently permanent; 
 
                 (b)  exempt from a country of origin marking requirement a 
                      good of another Party that 
 
                      (i)  is incapable of being marked, 
 
                      (ii) cannot be marked prior to exportation to the 
                           territory of another Party without causing 
                           injury to the goods, 
 
                      (iii)     cannot be marked except at a cost that is 
                                substantial in relation to its customs 
                                value so as to discourage its exportation 
                                to the territory of the Party, 
 
                                      Annex 311                             

                      (iv) cannot be marked without materially impairing 
                           its function or substantially detracting from 
                           its appearance, 
 
                      (v)  is in a container that is marked in a manner 
                           that will reasonably indicate the good's origin 
                           to the ultimate purchaser, 
 
                      (vi) is a crude substance, 
 
                      (vii)     is imported for use by the importer and is 
                                not intended for sale in the form in which 
                                it was imported, 
 
                      (viii)    is to undergo production in the territory 
                                of the importing Party by the importer, or 
                                on its behalf, in a manner that would 
                                result in the good becoming a good of the 
                                importing Party under the Marking Rules, 
 
                      (ix) by reason of its character, or the circumstances 
                           of its importation, the ultimate purchaser would 
                           reasonably know its country of origin even 
                           though it is not marked, 
 
                      (x)  was produced more than 20 years prior to its 
                           importation, 
 
                      (xi) was imported without the required marking and 
                           cannot be marked after its importation except at 
                           a cost that would be substantial in relation to 
                           its customs value, provided that the failure to 
                           mark the good before importation was not for the 
                           purpose of avoiding compliance with the 
                           requirement, 
 
                      (xii)     for purposes of temporary duty-free 
                                admission, is in transit or in bond or 
                                otherwise under customs administration 
                                control, 
 
                      (xiii)    is an original work of art, or 
 
                      (xiv)     is provided for in subheading 6904.10, or 
                                heading 8541 or 8542. 
 
            6.   Except for a good described in subparagraphs 5(b)(vi), 
            (vii), (viii), (ix), (x), (xii), (xiii) and (xiv), a Party may 
 
                                   Annex 311                                
 
            provide that, wherever a good is exempted under subparagraph 
            5(b), its outermost usual container shall be marked so as to 
            indicate the country of origin of the good it contains. 
 
            7.   Each Party shall provide that: 
 
                 (a)  a usual container imported empty, whether or not 
                      disposable, shall not be required to be marked with 
                      its own country of origin, but the container in which 
                      it is imported may be required to be marked with the 
                      country of origin of its contents; and 
 
                 (b)  a usual container imported filled, whether or not 
                      disposable, 
 
                      (i)  shall not be required to be marked with its own 
                           country of origin, but 
 
                      (ii) may be required to be marked with the country of 
                           origin of its contents, unless the contents are 
                           marked with their country of origin and the 
                           container can be readily opened for inspection 
                           of the contents, or the marking of the contents 
                           is clearly visible through the container. 
 
            8.   Each Party shall, wherever administratively practicable, 
            permit an importer to mark a good of a Party subsequent to 
            importation but prior to release of the good from customs 
            control or custody, unless there have been repeated violations 
            of the country of origin marking requirements of the Party by 
            the same importer and that importer has been previously 
            notified in writing that such good is required to be marked 
            prior to importation. 
 
            9.   Each Party shall provide that, except with respect to 
            importers that have been notified under paragraph 8, no special 
            duty or penalty shall be imposed for failure to comply with 
            country of origin marking requirements of that Party, unless 
            the good is removed from customs custody or control without 
            being properly marked, or a deceptive marking has been used. 
 
            10.  The Parties shall cooperate and consult on matters related 
            to this Annex, including additional exemptions from a country 
            of origin marking requirement, in accordance with Article 513

            distilled spirits, other than a measure covered by Article 
            312(1) or 313, shall be governed under this Agreement 
            exclusively in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
            Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement, which for this 
            purpose are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this 
            Agreement. 
 
 
                             Section B - Canada and Mexico 
 
            As between Canada and Mexico:

                 (c)  an amendment to a non-conforming provision of any 
                      existing measure to the extent that the amendment 
                      does not decrease its conformity with Article 301. 
 
            2.   The Party asserting that paragraph 1 applies to one of its 
            measures shall have the burden of establishing the validity of 
            such assertion.  
 
            3.   (a)  Any measure related to the listing of wine and 
                      distilled spirits of the other Party shall: 
 
                      (i)  conform with Article 301, 
 
                      (ii) be transparent, non-discriminatory and provide 
                           for prompt decision on any listing application, 
                           prompt written notification of such decision to 
                           the applicant and, in the case of a negative 
 
                                        Annex 312.2                         
 
                           decision, provide for a statement of the reason 
                           for refusal, 
 
                      (iii)     establish administrative appeal procedures 
                                for listing decisions that provide for 
                                prompt, fair and objective rulings, 
 
                      (iv) be based on normal commercial considerations, 
 
                      (v)  not create disguised barriers to trade, and

                 (b)  Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a) and Article 301, and 
                      provided that listing measures of British Columbia 
                      otherwise conform with paragraph 3(a) and Article 
                      301, automatic listing measures in the province of 
                      British Columbia may be maintained provided they 
                      apply only to existing estate wineries producing less 
                      than 30,000 gallons of wine annually and meeting the 
                      existing content rule. 
 
            4.   (a)  Where the distributor is a public entity, the entity 
                      may charge the actual cost-of-service differential 
                      between wine or distilled spirits of the other Party 
                      and domestic wine or distilled spirits.  Any such 
                      differential shall not exceed the actual amount by 
                      which the audited cost of service for the wine or 
                      distilled spirits of the exporting Party exceeds the 
                      audited cost of service for the wine or distilled 
                      spirits of the importing Party. 
 
                 (b)  Notwithstanding Article 301, Article I (Definitions) 
                      except for the definition of "distilled spirits", 
                      Article IV.3 (Wine), and Annexes A, B, and C, of the 
                      Agreement between Canada and the European Economic 
                      Community concerning Trade and Commerce in Alcoholic 
                      Beverages, dated February 28, 1989, shall apply with 
                      such changes as the circumstances may require. 
 
                 (c)  All discriminatory mark-ups on distilled spirits 
                      shall be eliminated immediately on the date of entry 
                      into force of this Agreement.  Cost-of-service 
                      differential mark-ups as described in subparagraph 
                      (a) shall be permitted.

                 (d)  Any other discriminatory pricing measure shall be 
                      eliminated on the date of entry into force of this 
                      Agreement. 
 
            5.   (a)  Any measure related to distribution of wine or 
                      distilled spirits of the other Party shall conform 
                      with Article 301. 
 
                 (b)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), and provided that 
                      distribution measures otherwise ensure conformity 
                      with Article 301, a Party may 
 
                      (i)  maintain or introduce a measure limiting on- 
                           premise sales by a winery or distillery to those 
                           wines or distilled spirits produced on its 
                           premises, and 
 
                      (ii) maintain a measure requiring existing private 
                           wine store outlets in the provinces of Ontario 
                           and British Columbia to discriminate in favor of 
                           wine of those provinces to a degree no greater 
                           than the discrimination required by such 
                           existing measure. 
 
                 (c)  Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Province 
                      of Quebec from requiring that any wine sold in 
                      grocery stores in Quebec be bottled in Quebec, 
                      provided that alternative outlets are provided in 
                      Quebec for the sale of wine of the other Party, 
                      whether or not such wine is bottled in Quebec. 
 
            6.   Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Annex, the 
            Parties retain their rights and obligations under the GATT and 
            agreements negotiated under the GATT.

            1.   Canada and Mexico shall recognize Bourbon Whiskey and 
            Tennessee Whiskey, which is a straight Bourbon Whiskey 
            authorized to be produced only in the State of Tennessee, as 
            distinctive products of the United States.  Accordingly, Canada 
            and Mexico shall not permit the sale of any product as Bourbon 
            Whiskey or Tennessee Whiskey, unless it has been manufactured 
            in the United States in accordance with the laws and 
            regulations of the United States governing the manufacture of 
            Bourbon Whiskey and Tennessee Whiskey. 
 
            2.   Mexico and the United States shall recognize Canadian 
            Whisky as a distinctive product of Canada.  Accordingly, Mexico 
            and the United States shall not permit the sale of any product 
            as Canadian Whisky, unless it has been manufactured in Canada 
            in accordance with the laws and regulations of Canada governing 
            the manufacture of Canadian Whisky for consumption in Canada. 
 
            3.   Canada and the United States shall recognize Tequila and 
            Mezcal as distinctive products of Mexico.  Accordingly, Canada 
            and the United States shall not permit the sale of any product 
            as Tequila or Mezcal, unless it has been manufactured in Mexico 
            in accordance with the laws and regulations of Mexico governing 
            the manufacture of Tequila and Mezcal.  This provision shall 
            apply to Mezcal, either on the date of entry into force of this 
            Agreement, or 90 days after the date when the official standard 
            for this product is made obligatory by the Government of 
            Mexico, whichever is later.

            1.   Mexico may adopt or maintain a duty, tax or other charge 
            on the export of those basic foodstuffs set out in paragraph 4, 
            on their ingredients or on the goods from which such foodstuffs 
            are derived, if such duty, tax or other charge is adopted or 
            maintained on the export of such goods to the territory of all 
            other Parties, and is used: 
 
                 (a)  to limit to domestic consumers the benefits of a 
                      domestic food assistance program with respect to such 
                      foodstuff; or 
 
                 (b)  to ensure the availability of sufficient quantities 
                      of such foodstuff to domestic consumers or of 
                      sufficient quantities of its ingredients, or of the 
                      goods from which such foodstuffs are derived, to a 
                      domestic processing industry, when the domestic price 
                      of such foodstuff is held below the world price as 
                      part of a governmental stabilization plan, provided 
                      that such duty, tax, or other charge 
 
                      (i)  does not operate to increase the protection 
                           afforded to such domestic industry, and 
 
                      (ii) is maintained only for such period of time as is 
                           necessary to maintain the integrity of the 
                           stabilization plan. 
 
            2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Mexico may adopt or maintain 
            a duty, tax or other charge on the export of any foodstuff to 
            the territory of another Party if such duty, tax or other 
            charge is temporarily applied to relieve critical shortages of 
            that foodstuff.  For purposes of this paragraph, "temporarily" 
            means up to one year, or such longer period as the Parties may 
            agree. 
 
            3.   Mexico may maintain its existing tax on the export of 
            goods provided for under tariff item 4001.30.02 of the Tariff 
            Schedule of the General Export Duty Act ("Tarifa de la Ley del 
            Impuesto General de Exportaci n") for up to 10 years after the 
            date of entry into force of this Agreement.

                                         Canada

            Existing Measures

            1.   Canada and the United States may maintain the Agreement
            Concerning Automotive Products between the Government of Canada
            and the Government of the United States of America, signed at
            Johnson City, Texas, January 16, 1965 and entered into force on
            September 16, 1966, in accordance with Article 1001, and
            Article 1002(1) and (4) (as they refer to Annex 1002.1, Part
            One), Article 1005(1) and (3), and Annex 1002.1, Part One
            (Waivers of Customs Duties) of the Canada - United States Free
            Trade Agreement, which provisions are hereby incorporated into
            and made a part of this Agreement for such purpose, except that
            for purposes of Article 1005(1) of that agreement, Chapter Four
            (Rules of Origin) of this Agreement shall be applied in the
            place of Chapter Three of the Canada - United States Free Trade
            Agreement.

            2.   Canada may maintain the measures referred to in Article
            1002(1) and (4) (as they refer to Annex 1002.1, Parts Two and
            Three), Article 1002(2) and (3), Article 1003 and Parts Two
            (Export-Based Waivers of Customs Duties) and Three (Production-
            Based Waivers of Customs Duties) of Annex 1002.1 of the
            Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement.  Canada shall
            eliminate those measures in accordance with the terms set out
            in that agreement.

            3.   For greater certainty, the differences in treatment
            pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be considered to be
            inconsistent with Article 1103 (Investment - Most-Favored-
            Nation Treatment).

            Used Vehicles

            4.   Canada may adopt or maintain prohibitions or restrictions
            on imports of used vehicles from the territory of Mexico,
            except as follows:

                 (a)  beginning January 1, 2009, Canada may not adopt or
                      maintain a prohibition or restriction on imports from
                      the territory of Mexico of originating used vehicles
                      that are at least 10 years old;

                 (b)  beginning January 1, 2011, Canada may not adopt or
                      maintain a prohibition or restriction on imports from
                      the territory of Mexico of originating used vehicles

                                        Annex 300-A                         

                      that are at least eight years old;

                 (c)  beginning January 1, 2013, Canada may not adopt or
                      maintain a prohibition or restriction on imports from
                      the territory of Mexico of originating used vehicles
                      that are at least six years old;

                 (d)  beginning January 1, 2015, Canada may not adopt or
                      maintain a prohibition or restriction on imports from
                      the territory of Mexico of originating used vehicles
                      that are at least four years old;

                 (e)  beginning January 1, 2017, Canada may not adopt or
                      maintain a prohibition or restriction on imports from
                      the territory of Mexico of originating used vehicles
                      that are at least two years old; and

                 (f)  beginning January 1, 2019, Canada may not adopt or
                      maintain a prohibition or restriction on imports from
                      the territory of Mexico of originating used vehicles.

            5.   Paragraph 4 shall not be construed to allow Canada to
            derogate from its obligations in respect of land transportation
            services under Chapter Twelve (Cross-Border Trade in Services),
            including its Schedule to Annex I.

                                     Annex 300-A                            

                                    Appendix 300-A.2

                                         Mexico

            Auto Decree and Auto Decree Implementing Regulations

            1.   Until January 1, 2004, Mexico may maintain the provisions
            of the Decree for Development and Modernization of the
            Automotive Industry ("Decreto para el Fomento y Modernizaci n
            de la Industria Automotriz"), December 11, 1989, (the "Auto
            Decree") and the Resolution that Establishes Rules for the
            Implementation of the Auto Decree ("Acuerdo que Determina
            Reglas para la Aplicaci n para el Fomento y Modernizaci n de la
            Industria Automotriz"), November 30, 1990, (the "Auto Decree
            Implementing Regulations") that would otherwise be inconsistent
            with this Agreement, subject to the conditions set out in
            paragraphs 2 through 18.  No later than January 1, 2004, Mexico
            shall bring any inconsistent provision of the Auto Decree and
            the Auto Decree Implementing Regulations into conformity with
            the other provisions of this Agreement.

            Autoparts Industry, National Suppliers and Independent
            Maquiladoras

            2.   Mexico may not require that an enterprise attain a level
            of national value added in excess of 20 percent of its total
            sales as one of the conditions to qualify as a national
            supplier or enterprise of the autoparts industry.

            3.   Mexico may require that a national supplier or an
            enterprise of the autoparts industry, in calculating its
            national value added solely for purposes of paragraph 2,
            include customs duties in the value of imports incorporated
            into the autoparts produced by such supplier or enterprise.

            4.   Mexico shall grant national supplier status to an
            independent maquiladora that requests such status and meets the
            requirements for that status set out in the existing Auto
            Decree, as modified by paragraphs 2 and 3.  Mexico shall
            continue to grant to all independent maquiladoras that request
            national supplier status all existing rights and privileges
            accorded to independent maquiladoras under the existing Decree
            for the Promotion and Operation of the Maquiladora Export
            Industry ("Decreto para el Fomento y Operaci n de la Industria
            Maquiladora de Exportaci n"), December 22, 1989 (the
            "Maquiladora Decree"). 

                                    Annex 300-A                             

            National Value Added

            5.   Mexico shall provide that a manufacturer ("empresa de la
            industria terminal") calculate its required national value
            added from suppliers (VANp) as a percentage of:

                 (a)  the manufacturer's reference value as set out in
                      paragraph 8; or

                 (b)  the manufacturer's total national value added (VANt),

            whichever is greater, except that Mexico shall provide that a
            manufacturer beginning production of motor vehicles in Mexico
            after model year 1991 calculate its required national value
            added from suppliers (VANp) as a percentage of its total
            national value added (VANt).

            6.   Mexico may not require that the percentage referred to in
            paragraph 5 be greater than:

                 (a)  34 percent for each of the first five years beginning
                      January 1, 1994;

                 (b)  33 percent for 1999;

                 (c)  32 percent for 2000;

                 (d)  31 percent for 2001;

                 (e)  30 percent for 2002; and

                 (f)  29 percent for 2003.

            7.   Notwithstanding paragraph 6, Mexico shall allow a
            manufacturer that produced motor vehicles in Mexico before
            model year 1992 to use as its percentage referred to in
            paragraph 5 the ratio of actual national value added from
            suppliers (VANp) to total national value added (VANt) that the
            manufacturer attained in model year 1992, for so long as that
            ratio is lower than the applicable percentage specified under
            paragraph 6.  In determining such ratio for model year 1992,
            purchases that the manufacturer made from independent
            maquiladoras that would have been eligible to receive national
            supplier status had paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Appendix been
            in effect at that time, shall be included in the calculation of
            the manufacturer's national value added from suppliers (VANp),
            in the same manner as autoparts from any other national
            supplier or enterprise of the autoparts industry.

                                    Annex 300-A                             

            8.   The annual reference value for a manufacturer ("reference
            value") shall be:

                 (a)  for each of the years 1994 through 1997, the base
                      value for the manufacturer, plus no more than 65
                      percent of the difference between the manufacturer's
                      total sales in Mexico in that year and its base
                      value;

                 (b)  for each of the years 1998 through 2000, the base
                      value for the manufacturer, plus no more than 60
                      percent of the difference between the manufacturer's
                      total sales in Mexico in that year and its base
                      value; and

                 (c)  for each of the years 2001 through 2003, the base
                      value for the manufacturer, plus no more than 50
                      percent of the difference between the manufacturer's
                      total sales in Mexico in that year and its base
                      value.

            9.   Mexico shall provide that where a manufacturer's total
            sales in Mexico in a year are lower than its base value, the
            reference value for the manufacturer for that year shall be
            equal to the manufacturer's total sales in Mexico for the year.

            10.  In the event an abnormal production disruption affects a
            manufacturer's production capability, Mexico shall allow the
            manufacturer to seek a reduction in its reference value before
            the Intersecretariat Automotive Industry Commission,
            established under Chapter V of the Auto Decree.  If the
            Commission finds that the production capability of the
            manufacturer has been impaired by such an abnormal production
            disruption, the Commission shall reduce the manufacturer's
            reference value in an amount commensurate to the event.

            11.  If, on the request of a manufacturer, the Intersecretariat
            Automotive Industry Commission finds that the production
            capability of the manufacturer has been significantly disrupted
            as a result of a major retooling or plant conversion in the
            facilities of the manufacturer, the Commission shall reduce the
            manufacturer's reference value for that year in an amount
            commensurate with the disruption, provided that any reduction
            in that manufacturer's required national value added from
            suppliers (VANp) that may result from the Commission's
            determination to reduce the manufacturer's reference value
            shall be fully made up by the manufacturer over the 24 months
            after the date on which the retooling or plant conversion is
            completed.

                               Annex 300-A                                  

            Trade Balance

            12.  Mexico may not require a manufacturer to include in the
            calculation of its trade balance (S) a percentage of the value
            of direct and indirect imports of autoparts that the
            manufacturer incorporated into that manufacturer's production
            in Mexico for sale in Mexico (VTVd) in the corresponding year,
            greater than the following:

                 (a)  80 percent for 1994; 

                 (b)  77.2 percent for 1995;

                 (c)  74.4 percent for 1996;

                 (d)  71.6 percent for 1997;

                 (e)  68.9 percent for 1998;

                 (f)  66.1 percent for 1999; 

                 (g)  63.3 percent for 2000;

                 (h)  60.5 percent for 2001;

                 (i)  57.7 percent for 2002; and

                 (j)  55.0 percent for 2003.

            13.  Mexico shall provide that, for purposes of determining a
            manufacturer's total national value added (VANt), paragraph 12
            shall not apply to the calculation of the manufacturer's trade
            balance (S).

            14.  Mexico shall allow a manufacturer with a surplus in its
            extended trade balance to divide its extended trade balance by
            the applicable percentages in paragraph 12 to determine the
            total value of new motor vehicles that it may import.

            15.  Mexico shall provide that a manufacturer's adjustment
            factor (Y), included in the calculation of such manufacturer's
            extended trade balance, shall be equal to:

                 (a)  for a manufacturer that produced motor vehicles prior
                      to model year 1992

                      (i)  the greater of the manufacturer's reference
                           value or the manufacturer's total national value
                           added (VANt), minus

                                     Annex 300-A                            

                      (ii) the manufacturer's actual national value added
                           from suppliers (VANp) divided by the appropriate
                           percentage specified under paragraph 6 or 7 as
                           appropriate;

                 (b)  for all other manufacturers

                      (i)  the manufacturer's total national value added
                           (VANt), minus

                      (ii) the manufacturer's actual national value added
                           from suppliers (VANp) divided by the appropriate
                           percentage specified under paragraph 6,

            except that the adjustment factor (Y) shall be zero if the
            amount resulting from subtracting (ii) from (i), under (a) or
            (b), is negative.

            16.  In determining the annual amount that a manufacturer may
            apply to its extended trade balance from unused surpluses
            earned prior to model year 1991, Mexico shall in any year allow
            the manufacturer to elect:

                 (a)  to use the procedures of the existing Auto Decree
                      Implementing Regulations; or

                 (b)  to apply up to the Mexican peso equivalent of US$150
                      million, adjusted annually for cumulative inflation,
                      from the date of entry into force of this Agreement,
                      based on the implicit price deflator for U.S. Gross
                      Domestic Product (GDP) or any successor index
                      published by the Council of Economic Advisers in its
                      "Economic Indicators" (hereinafter "U.S. GDP price
                      deflator").  To adjust the US$150 million ceiling for
                      cumulative inflation up to a certain month of a year
                      following 1994, the $150 million shall be multiplied
                      by the ratio of

                      (i)  the U.S. GDP price deflator current as of the
                           month of that year, to 

                      (ii) the U.S. GDP price deflator current as of the
                           date of entry into force of this Agreement,

                      provided that the price deflators under subparagraphs
                      (i) and (ii) have the same base year. 

                      The resulting adjusted amount shall be rounded to the
                      nearest million dollars.

                                   Annex 300-A                              

            Other Restrictions in the Auto Decree

            17.  Mexico shall eliminate any restriction that limits the
            number of motor vehicles that a manufacturer may import into
            Mexico in relation to the total number of motor vehicles that

            the automobile is completed in Canada or Mexico and such
            automobile is not imported into the United States prior to the
            expiration of the 30 days following the end of the model year. 

            2.   Paragraph 1 shall apply to all automobiles produced by a
            manufacturer and sold in the United States, wherever produced
            and irrespective of car line or truck line, in accordance with
            the following schedule:

                 (a)  with respect to a manufacturer that initiated the
                      production of automobiles in Mexico before model year
                      1992, the enterprise subject to the fuel economy
                      requirements for those automobiles under the CAFE Act
                      may make a one-time election at any time between
                      January 1, 1997 and 
                      January 1, 2004, to have paragraph 1 applied
                      beginning with the next model year after its
                      election;

                 (b)  with respect to a manufacturer initiating the
                      production of automobiles in Mexico after model year
                      1991, paragraph 1 shall apply beginning with the next
                      model year after either January 1, 1994 or the date
                      that the manufacturer initiates the production of
                      automobiles in Mexico, whichever is later;

                 (c)  with respect to any other manufacturer producing
                      automobiles in the territory of a Party, the
                      enterprise subject to the fuel economy requirements
                      for those automobiles under the CAFE Act may make a
                      one-time election at any time between January 1, 1997
                      and January 1, 2004, to have paragraph 1 applied
                      beginning with the next model year after its
                      election.  If such a manufacturer initiates the
                      production of automobiles in Mexico, it shall be
                      subject to subparagraph (b) on the date it initiates
                      such production;

                                   Annex 300-A                              

                 (d)  with respect to all manufacturers of automobiles not
                      producing automobiles in the territory of a Party,
                      paragraph 1 shall apply beginning with the next model
                      year after January 1, 1994; and

                 (e)  with respect to a manufacturer of automobiles covered
                      by subparagraph (a) or (c), paragraph 1 shall apply
                      beginning with the next model year after January 1,
                      2004, where the enterprise subject to the fuel
                      economy requirements for those automobiles under the
                      CAFE Act, has not made an election under subparagraph
                      (a) or (c).

            3.   The United States shall ensure that any measure it adopts
            pertaining to the definition of domestic production in the CAFE
            Act or its implementing regulations shall apply equally to
            value added in Canada or Mexico.

            4.   Nothing in this Appendix shall be construed to require the
            United States to make any changes in its fuel economy
            requirements for automobiles, or to prevent the United States
            from making any changes in its fuel economy requirements for
            automobiles that are otherwise consistent with this Appendix.

            5.   For greater certainty, the differences in treatment
            pursuant to paragraphs 1 through 3 shall not be considered to
            be inconsistent with Article 1103 (Investment - Most-Favored-
            Nation Treatment).

            6.    For purposes of this Appendix:

            automobile means "automobile" as defined in the CAFE Act and
            its implementing regulations;

            manufacturer means "manufacturer" as defined in the CAFE Act
            and its implementing regulations; and

            1.   This Annex applies to the textile and apparel goods set
            out in Appendix 1.1.

            2.   In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement
            and the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles
            (Multifiber Arrangement), as amended and extended, including
            any amendment or extension after January 1, 1994, or any other
            existing or future agreement applicable to trade in textile or
            apparel goods, this Agreement shall prevail to the extent of
            the inconsistency, unless the Parties agree otherwise.


            Section 2:  Tariff Elimination

            1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party
            shall progressively eliminate its customs duties on originating
            textile and apparel goods in accordance with its Schedule to
            Annex 302.2 (Tariff Elimination), and as set out for ease of
            reference in Appendix 2.1.

            2.   For purposes of this Annex: 

                 (a)  a textile or apparel good shall be considered an
                      originating good if the applicable change in tariff
                      classification set out in Chapter Four (Rules of
                      Origin) has been satisfied in the territory of one or
                      more of the Parties in accordance with Article 404
                      (Accumulation); and 

                 (b)  for purposes of determining which rate of customs
                      duty and staging category is applicable to an
                      originating textile or apparel good, a good shall be
                      considered a good of a Party  

                      (i)  as determined by each importing Party's
                           regulations, practices or procedures, except
                           that

                                   Annex 300-B                              

                      (ii) in the event of an agreement between the Parties
                           pursuant to Annex 311(1) (Country of Origin
                           Marking), as determined by such agreement.

            3.   An importing Party and an exporting Party may identify at
            any time particular textile and apparel goods that they
            mutually agree fall within:

                 (a)  hand-loomed fabrics of a cottage industry; 

                 (b)  hand-made cottage industry goods made of such hand-
                      loomed fabrics; or 

                 (c)  traditional folklore handicraft goods.

            The importing Party shall grant duty-free treatment to goods so
            identified, if certified by the competent authority of the
            exporting Party.

            4.    Appendix 2.4 applies to the Parties specified in that
            Appendix respecting the elimination of tariffs on certain
            textile and apparel goods.


            Section 3:  Import and Export Prohibitions, Restrictions and
            Consultation Levels

            1.   Each Party may maintain a prohibition, restriction or
            consultation level only in accordance with Appendix 3.1 or as
            otherwise provided in this Annex.

            2.   Each Party shall eliminate any prohibition, restriction or
            consultation level on a textile or apparel good that otherwise
            would be permitted under this Annex if that Party is required
            to eliminate such measure as a result of having integrated that
            good into the GATT as a result of commitments undertaken by
            that Party under any successor agreement to the Multifiber
            Arrangement.


            Section 4:  Bilateral Emergency Actions (Tariff Actions)

            1.   Subject to paragraphs 2 through 5 and during the
            transition period only, if, as a result of the reduction or
            elimination of a duty provided for in this Agreement, a textile
            or apparel good originating in the territory of a Party, or a
            good that has been integrated into the GATT pursuant to a
            commitment undertaken by a Party under any successor agreement

                                 Annex 300-B                                

            to the Multifiber Arrangement and entered under a tariff
            preference level set out in Appendix 6, is being imported into
            the territory of another Party in such increased quantities, in
            absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that
            good, and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or
            actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like
            or directly competitive good, the importing Party may, to the
            minimum extent necessary to remedy the damage or actual threat
            thereof:
             
                 (a)  suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty
                      provided for under this Agreement on the good; or

                 (b)  increase the rate of duty on the good to a level not
                      to exceed the lesser of

                      (i)  the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of
                           duty in effect at the time the action is taken,
                           and

                      (ii) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on
                           December 31, 1993.

            2.   In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof,
            the Party:  

                 (a)  shall examine the effect of increased imports on the
                      particular industry, as reflected in changes in such
                      relevant economic variables as output, productivity,
                      utilization of capacity, inventories, market share,
                      exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits
                      and investment, none of which is necessarily
                      decisive; and 

                 (b)  shall not consider changes in technology or consumer
                      preference as factors supporting a determination of
                      serious damage or actual threat thereof.

            3.   A Party shall deliver without delay to any Party that may
            be affected by an emergency action taken under this Section
            written notice of its intent to take such action, and on
            request shall enter into consultations with that Party.

            4.   The following conditions and limitations apply to any
            emergency action taken under this Section:

                 (a)  no action may be maintained for a period exceeding
                      three years or, except with the consent of the Party

                                 Annex 300-B                                

                      against whose good the action is taken, have effect
                      beyond the expiration of the transition period;

                 (b)  no action may be taken by a Party against any
                      particular good originating in the territory of
                      another Party more than once during the transition
                      period; and

                 (c)  on termination of the action, the rate of duty shall
                      be the rate that, according to the Schedule for the
                      staged elimination of the tariff, would have been in
                      effect one year after the initiation of the action,
                      and beginning January 1 of the year following the
                      termination of the action, at the option of the Party
                      that has taken the action

                      (i)  the rate of duty shall conform to the applicable
                           rate set out in that Party's Schedule to Annex
                           302.2, or

                      (ii) the tariff shall be eliminated in equal annual
                           stages ending on the date set out in that
                           Party's Schedule to Annex 302.2 for the
                           elimination of the tariff.

            5.   The Party taking an action under this Section shall
            provide to the Party against whose good the action is taken
            mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of
            concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or
            equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to
            result from the action.  Such concessions shall be limited to
            the textile and apparel goods set out in Appendix 1.1, unless
            the Parties otherwise agree.  If the Parties concerned are
            unable to agree on compensation, the exporting Party may take
            tariff action having trade effects substantially equivalent to
            the action taken under this Section against any goods imported
            from the Party that initiated the action under this Section. 
            The Party taking the tariff action shall only apply the action
            for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially
            equivalent effects.

            6.   For purposes of this Section, a good originating in the
            territory of a Party shall be determined in accordance with
            Section 2.2.

            7.   Paragraphs 1 through 5 shall also apply to textile and
            apparel goods described in Appendix 2.4.

                                  Annex 300-B                               

            Section 5:  Bilateral Emergency Actions (Quantitative
            Restrictions)

            1.   Subject to Appendix 5.1, a Party may take bilateral
            emergency action against non-originating textile or apparel
            goods of another Party in accordance with this Section and
            Appendix 3.1.

            2.   If a Party considers that a non-originating textile or
            apparel good, including a good entered under a tariff
            preference level set out in Appendix 6, is being imported into
            its territory from a Party in such increased quantities, in
            absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that
            good, under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or
            actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like
            or directly competitive good in the importing Party, the
            importing Party may request consultations with the other Party
            with a view to eliminating the serious damage or actual threat
            thereof.

            3.   The Party requesting consultations shall include in its
            request for consultations the reasons that it considers
            demonstrate that such serious damage or actual threat thereof
            to its domestic industry is resulting from the imports of the
            other Party, including the latest data concerning such damage
            or threat.

            4.   In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof,
            the Party shall apply Section 4(2).

            5.   The Parties concerned shall begin consultations within 60
            days of the request for consultations and shall endeavor to
            agree on a mutually satisfactory level of restraint on exports
            of the particular good within 90 days of the request, unless
            the consulting Parties agree to extend this period.  In
            reaching a mutually satisfactory level of export restraint, the
            consulting Parties shall:

                 (a)  consider the situation in the market in the importing
                      Party;

                 (b)  consider the history of trade in textile and apparel
                      goods between the consulting Parties, including
                      previous levels of trade; and

                 (c)  seek to ensure that the textile and apparel goods
                      imported from the territory of the exporting Party
                      are accorded equitable treatment as compared with

                                    Annex 300-B                             

                      treatment accorded like textile and apparel goods
                      from non-Party suppliers.

            6.   If the consulting Parties do not agree on a mutually
            satisfactory level of export restraint, the Party requesting
            consultations may impose annual quantitative restrictions on
            imports of the good from the territory of the other Party,
            subject to paragraphs 7 through 13. 

            7.   Any quantitative restriction imposed under paragraph 6
                 shall be no less than the sum of:

                 (a)  the quantity of the good imported into the territory
                      of the Party requesting consultations from the Party
                      that would be affected by the restriction, as
                      reported in general import statistics of the
                      importing Party, during the first 12 of the most
                      recent 14 months preceding the month in which the
                      request for consultations was made; and

                 (b)  20 percent of such quantity for cotton, man-made
                      fiber and other non-cotton vegetable fiber good
                      categories, and six percent for wool good categories.

            8.   The first period of any quantitative restriction imposed
            under paragraph 6 shall begin on the day after the date on
            which the request for consultations was made and terminate at
            the end of the calendar year in which the quantitative
            restriction is imposed.  Any quantitative restriction that is
            imposed for a first period of less than 12 months shall be
            prorated to correspond to the time remaining in the calendar
            year in which the restriction is imposed, and the prorated
            amount may be adjusted in accordance with the flexibility
            provisions set out in paragraphs 8(b) and (c) of Appendix 3.1.

            9.   For each successive calendar year that the quantitative
            restriction imposed under paragraph 6 remains in effect, the
            Party imposing it shall: 

                 (a)  increase it by six percent for cotton, man-made fiber
                      and non-cotton vegetable fiber textile and apparel
                      goods, and by two percent for wool textile and
                      apparel goods, and

                 (b)  accelerate the growth rate for quantitative
                      restrictions on cotton, man-made fiber and non-cotton
                      vegetable fiber textile and apparel goods if required

                                    Annex 300-B                             

                      by any successor agreement to the Multifiber
                      Arrangement, 

            and the flexibility provisions set out in paragraphs 8(b) and
            (c) of Appendix 3.1 apply. 

            10.  A quantitative restriction imposed under paragraph 6
            before July 1 in any calendar year may remain in effect for the
            remainder of that year, plus two additional calendar years.  
            Such a restriction imposed on or after July 1 in any calendar
            year may remain in effect for the remainder of that year, plus
            three additional calendar years.  No such restriction may
            remain in effect beyond the transition period.

            11.  No Party may take an emergency action under this Section
            with respect to any particular textile or apparel non-
            originating good against which a quantitative restriction is in
            effect.

            12.  No Party may adopt or maintain a quantitative restriction
            under this Section on a particular textile or apparel good that
            otherwise would be permitted under this Annex, if that Party is
            required to eliminate such measure as a result of having
            integrated that good into the GATT as a result of commitments
            undertaken by that Party pursuant to any successor agreement to
            the Multifiber Arrangement.

            13.  No Party may take a bilateral emergency action after the
            expiration of the transition period with respect to cases of
            serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to domestic industry
            arising from the operation of this Agreement except with the
            consent of the Party against whose good the action would be
            taken.


            Section 6:  Special Provisions

                 Appendix 6 sets out special provisions applicable to
            certain textile and apparel goods.


            Section 7:  Review and Revision of Rules of Origin

            1.   (a)  The Parties shall monitor the effects of the
                      application of the rule of origin set out in Annex
                      401 applicable to goods of subheading 6212.10 of the
                      Harmonized System (HS).  No earlier than April 1,
                      1995, a Party may request consultations with the

                                   Annex 300-B                              

                      other Parties to seek a mutually satisfactory
                      solution to any difficulties that it considers result
                      from the application of that rule of origin.

                 (b)  If the consulting Parties fail to reach a mutually
                      satisfactory solution within 90 days of a request for
                      consultations, on request of any Party the rule of
                      origin applicable to subheading 6212.10 shall change
                      to the rule of origin set out in Annex 401 applicable
                      to headings 62.06 through 62.11 with respect to trade
                      between the requesting Party and the other Parties.  
                      Any such change shall be effective 180 days after the
                      request.  The Parties shall take measures to ease any
                      resulting administrative burden on producers.

                 (c)  Unless the Parties agree otherwise, at any time after
                      the completion of consultations held under
                      subparagraph (a) and during the transition period
                      only, a Party that has requested such consultations
                      may make one additional request for consultations
                      under subparagraph (a) and take action under
                      subparagraph (b).

            2.   (a)  On request of any Party, the Parties shall consult to
                      consider whether particular goods should be subject
                      to different rules of origin to address issues of
                      availability of supply of fibers, yarns or fabrics in
                      the free trade area.

                 (b)  In the consultations, each Party shall consider all
                      data presented by a Party showing substantial
                      production in its territory of the particular good. 
                      The consulting Parties shall consider that
                      substantial production has been shown if that Party
                      demonstrates that its domestic producers are capable
                      of supplying commercial quantities of the good in a
                      timely manner.

                 (c)  The Parties shall endeavor to conclude consultations
                      within 60 days of the request.  An agreement between
                      two or more Parties resulting from the consultations
                      shall supersede any prior rule of origin for such
                      good when approved by each such Party in accordance
                      with Article 2202(2) (Amendments).  If no agreement
                      is reached, a Party may have recourse to paragraph
                      B.8 of Appendix 6.

                                    Annex 300-B                             

                 (d)  Further to subparagraph (a), on request of any Party,
                      the Parties shall consult to consider whether the
                      rules of origin set out in Annex 401 applicable to
                      the following provisions should be amended in view of
                      increasing availability of supply of relevant yarns
                      or fabrics within the free trade area:

                      (i)  Canadian tariff item 5407.60.10, Mexican tariff
                           item 5407.60.02 and U.S. tariff item 5407.60.22, 


                      (ii) provisions (a) through (i) of the rule of origin
                           for subheadings 6205.20 through 6205.30, 

                      (iii)     goods of subheadings 6107.21, 6108.21 and
                                6108.31, wholly of fabric of Canadian
                                tariff item 6002.92.10, Mexican tariff item
                                6002.92.01, and U.S. tariff item
                                6002.92.10, and exclusive of collar, cuffs,
                                waistband, elastic or lace; 

                      (iv) note 2 to Chapter 62 of Annex 401, and 

                      (v)  Canadian tariff item 6303.92.10, Mexican tariff
                           item 6303.92.01 and U.S. tariff item 6303.92.aa.

            3.   The Parties shall review the rules of origin applicable to
            textile and apparel goods within five years of the date of
            entry into force of this Agreement to take into account the
            effect of increasing global competition on textile and apparel
            goods and the implications of any integration into the GATT of
            textile and apparel goods pursuant to any successor agreement
            to the Multifiber Arrangement.  The Parties shall give
            particular consideration to operative rules in other economic
            association or integration agreements and developments relating
            to textile and apparel production and trade. 

            Section 8:  Labelling Requirements

                 The Subcommittee on Labelling of Textile and Apparel Goods
            established under Article 913(5) shall perform the functions
            set out in Annex 913.5.a-4. 


            Section 9:  Trade in Worn Clothing and Other Worn Articles

                               Annex 300-B                                  

            1.   The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Trade in Worn
            Clothing, comprising representatives of each Party.  The
            Committee shall:

                 (a)  include or consult with a broadly representative
                      group drawn from the manufacturing and retailing
                      sectors in each Party; and

                 (b)  act in a transparent manner and, if no member of the
                      Committee formally objects, make recommendations to
                      the Commission.

            2.   The Committee shall assess the potential benefits and
            risks that may result from the elimination of existing
            restrictions on trade between the Parties in worn clothing and
            other worn articles, as defined in heading 63.09 of the HS,
            including the effects on business and employment opportunities,
            and on the market for textile and apparel goods in each Party.

            3.   A Party may maintain restrictions in effect on the date of
            entry into force of this Agreement on the importation of worn
            clothing and other worn articles classified under  heading
            63.09 of the HS, unless the Parties agree otherwise on the
            basis of the recommendations presented to the Commission by the
            Committee on Trade in Worn Clothing.


            Section 10:  Definitions

            For purposes of this Annex:

            average yarn number, as applied to woven fabrics of cotton or
            man-made fibers, means the average yarn number of the yarns
            contained therein.  In computing the average yarn number, the
            length of the yarn is considered to be equal to the distance
            covered by it in the fabric, with all clipped yarn being
            measured as if continuous and with the count being taken of the
            total single yarns in the fabric including the single yarns in
            any multiple (folded) or cabled yarns.  The weight shall be
            taken after any excessive sizing is removed by boiling or other
            suitable process.  Any one of the following formulas can be
            used to determine the average yarn number:

                      N =   BYT   ,   100T   , BT   or    ST 
                           1,000       Z'      Z          10
    

                 when:
                                Annex 300-B                                 

                       N is the average yarn number,
                       B is the breadth (width) of the fabric in
            centimeters,
                       Y is the meters (linear) of the fabric per
            kilogram,
                       T is the total single yarns per square centimeter,
                       S is the square meters of fabric per kilogram,
                       Z is the grams per linear meter of fabric, and
                       Z' is the grams per square meter of fabric.

                 Fractions in the resulting "average yarn number" shall be
            disregarded.  

            category means a grouping of textile or apparel goods, and as
            set out in Appendix 10.1 for the Parties specified in that
            Appendix;

            textile or apparel good that may be adjusted in accordance with
            paragraph 7 of Appendix 3.1 and includes a designated
            consultation level, but does not include a specific limit;

            exporting Party means the Party from whose territory a textile
            or apparel good is exported;

            flexibility provisions means the provisions set out in
            paragraphs 8(b) and (c) of Appendix 3.1; 

            importing Party means the Party into whose territory a textile
            or apparel good is imported;

            integrated into the GATT means subject to the obligations of
            the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an agreement under
            the GATT or any successor agreements;

            specific limit means a level of exports for a particular
            textile or apparel good that may be adjusted in accordance with

            that results from the application of the conversion factors set
            out in Schedule 3.1.3 to a primary unit of measure such as
            unit, dozen or kilogram;

            tariff preference level means a mechanism that provides for the

            different rate to imports of that good that exceed that
            quantity;

            transition period means the 10-year period beginning on January
            1, 1994; and

                          Restrictions and Consultation Levels


            A.  Trade between Canada and Mexico and between Mexico and the
            United States

            1.   This Appendix applies to prohibitions, restrictions and
            consultation levels on non-originating textile and apparel
            goods.

            2.   An exporting Party whose textile or apparel good is
            subject to a prohibition, restriction or consultation level
            shall limit its annual exports to the specified limits or
            levels, and the importing Party may assist the exporting Party
            in implementing the prohibition, restriction or consultation
            level by controlling its imports.

                            Annex 300-B                                     

            3.   Each Party shall count exports of textile and apparel
            goods subject to a restriction or consultation level against
            the limit or level:

                 (a)   applicable to the calendar year in which the good
                       was exported; or

                 (b)   authorized for the following year if such exports
                       exceed the authorized limit or level for the
                       calendar year in which the good was exported, if
                       allowed entry into the territory of the importing
                       Party.

            4.   Each exporting Party whose goods are subject to a
            restriction or consultation level shall endeavor to space
            exports of such goods to the territory of the importing Party
            evenly throughout each calendar year, taking into consideration
            normal seasonal factors.

            5.   On written request of an exporting Party whose goods are
            subject to a prohibition, restriction or consultation level,
            that Party and the importing Party shall consult within 30 days
            of receipt of the request on any matter arising from the
            implementation of this Appendix.

            6.   On written request of an exporting Party that considers
            the application of a prohibition, restriction or consultation
            level under this Annex has placed it in an inequitable position
            in relation to another Party or a non-Party, the exporting
            Party and importing Party shall consult within 60 days of
            receipt of the request to seek a mutually beneficial solution.

            7.   An importing Party and an exporting Party, at any time by
            mutual agreement, may adjust annual Designated Consultation
            Levels (DCLs) as follows:

                 (a)   if the exporting Party whose goods are subject to a
                       DCL wishes to export goods in any category in
                       excess of the applicable DCL in any calendar year,
                       that Party may present to the importing Party a
                       formal written request for an increase in the DCL;
                       and

                 (b)   the importing Party shall respond, in writing,
                       within 30 days of the receipt of the request.  If
                       the response is negative, the Parties concerned
                       shall consult no later than 15 days after the
                       receipt of the response or as soon thereafter as

                                    Annex 300-B                             

                       mutually convenient, and shall endeavor to reach a
                       mutually satisfactory solution.  The Parties
                       concerned shall confirm any agreement reached on a
                       new DCL by an exchange of letters.

            8.   Adjustments to annual specific limits (SLs), including
            those set out in Schedule 3.1.2, may be made as follows:

                 (a)   an exporting Party wishing to adjust an SL shall
                       deliver a notice to the importing Party of its
                       intent to make an adjustment;

                 (b)   the exporting Party may increase the SL for a
                       calendar year by no more than six percent
                       ("swing"); and

                 (c)   in addition to any increase of its SL under
                       subparagraph (b), the exporting Party may increase
                       its unadjusted SL for that year by no more than 11
                       percent by allocating to such SL for that calendar
                       year (the "receiving year") an unused portion
                       ("shortfall") of the corresponding SL for the
                       previous calendar year ("carryover") or a portion
                       of the corresponding SL for the following calendar
                       year ("carryforward"), as follows:

                       (i)      subject to subparagraph (iii), the
                                exporting Party may utilize carryover, as
                                available, up to 11 percent of the
                                unadjusted SL for the receiving year,

                       (ii)     the exporting Party may utilize
                                carryforward charged against the
                                corresponding SL for the following calendar
                                year, up to six percent of the unadjusted
                                SL for the receiving year,

                       (iii)    the combination of the exporting Party's
                                carryover and carryforward shall not exceed
                                11 percent of the unadjusted SL in the
                                receiving year, and

                       (iv)     carryover may be utilized only following
                                confirmation by the importing Party that
                                sufficient shortfall exists.  If the
                                importing Party does not consider that
                                sufficient shortfall exists, it shall
                                promptly provide data to the exporting

                            Annex 300-B                                     

                                Party to support that view.  Where
                                substantial statistical differences exist
                                between the import and export data on which
                                the shortfall is computed, the Parties
                                concerned shall seek to resolve these
                                differences promptly.


            B.  Trade between Mexico and the United States

            9.   During the transition period, non-originating textile and
            apparel goods of Mexico exported to the United States shall be
            subject to the restrictions and consultation levels specified
            in Schedule 3.1.2, in accordance with this Appendix and its
            Schedules.  Such restrictions and consultation levels shall be
            progressively eliminated as follows:

                 (a)   restrictions or consultation levels on items
                       contained in the categories of textile and apparel
                       goods in staging category 1 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall
                       be eliminated on January 1, 1994;

                 (b)   restrictions or consultation levels on items
                       contained in the categories of textile and apparel
                       goods in staging category 2 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall
                       be eliminated on January 1, 2001; and

                 (c)   restrictions or consultation levels on items
                       contained in the categories of textile and apparel
                       goods in staging category 3 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall
                       be eliminated on January 1, 2004.

            10.  In addition, on January 1, 1994, the United States shall
            eliminate restrictions or consultation levels on textile and
            apparel goods that are assembled in Mexico from fabrics wholly
            formed and cut in the United States and exported from and
            reimported into the United States under:  

                 (a)   U.S. tariff item 9802.00.80.10; or

                 (b)   Chapter 61, 62 or 63 if, after such assembly, those
                       goods that would have qualified for treatment under
                       9802.00.80.10 have been subject to bleaching,
                       garment dyeing, stone-washing, acid-washing or
                       perma-pressing.

            Thereafter, notwithstanding Section 5, the United States shall
            not adopt or maintain prohibitions, restrictions or

                                 Annex 300-B                                

            consultation levels on textile and apparel goods of Mexico that
            satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (a) or (b) or the
            requirements of any successor provision to U.S. tariff item
            9802.00.80.10.

            11.  Mexico and the United States may identify at any time
            particular textile and apparel goods that they mutually agree
            fall within:

                 (a)   hand-loomed fabrics of a cottage industry;

                 (b)   hand-made cottage industry goods made of such hand-
                       loomed fabrics; or

                 (c)   traditional folklore handicraft goods. 

            The importing Party shall exempt from restrictions and
            consultation levels goods so identified, if certified by the
            competent authority of the exporting Party.

            12.  The Bilateral Textile Agreement Between the United States
            of America and the United Mexican States, signed at Mazatl n,
            February 13, 1988, as amended and extended (the Bilateral
            Agreement), shall terminate on the date of entry into force of
            this Agreement.

            13.  On request of either Party, the Parties shall consult to
            consider accelerating the elimination of restrictions or
            consultation levels set out in Schedule 3.1.2 on specific
            textile and apparel goods.  An agreement between the Parties to
            accelerate the elimination of a restriction or consultation
            level shall supersede Schedule 3.1.1 when approved by each such
            Party in accordance with Article 2202(2) (Amendments).

            14.  During 1994, Mexico may carry over any unused portion of
            the 1993 limit specified in the Bilateral Agreement, or apply
            against the 1994 limit specified in this Appendix any exports
            made during 1993 in excess of the applicable limit under the
            Bilateral Agreement, in accordance with the flexibility
            provisions set forth in paragraph 8.

            15.  All exports of textile and apparel goods from the
            territory of Mexico to the territory of the United States
            covered by restrictions or consultation levels under this
            Appendix shall be accompanied by an export visa issued by the
            competent authority of Mexico, pursuant to any bilateral visa
            arrangement in effect between the Parties.

                               Annex 300-B                                  

            16.  On written request of either Party, both Parties shall
            consult within 30 days of receipt of the request on any matter
            arising from the implementation of this Appendix.  In addition,
            on written request of either Party, both Parties shall conduct
            a review of this Appendix by January 1, 1999.

            17.  For purposes of applying prohibitions, restrictions or
            consultation levels, each Party shall consider a good as being
            of:

                 (a)   man-made fibers if the good is in chief weight of
                       man-made fibers, unless

                       (i)      the good is knitted or crocheted apparel in
                                which wool equals or exceeds 23 percent by
                                weight of all fibers, in which case it
                                shall be of wool,

                       (ii)     the good is apparel, not knitted or
                                crocheted, in which wool equals or exceeds
                                36 percent by weight of all fibers, in
                                which case it shall be of wool, or

                       (iii)    the good is a woven fabric in which wool
                                equals or exceeds 36 percent by weight of
                                all fibers, in which case it shall be of
                                wool;

                 (b)   cotton, if not covered by subparagraph (a) and if
                       the good is in chief weight of cotton, unless the
                       good is a woven fabric in which wool equals or
                       exceeds 36 percent by weight of all fibers, in
                       which case it shall be of wool;

                 (c)   wool, if not covered by subparagraph (a) or (b),
                       and the good is in chief weight of wool; and

                 (d)   non-cotton vegetable fiber, if not covered by
                       subparagraph (a), (b) or (c), and the good is in
                       chief weight of non-cotton vegetable fiber, unless

                       (i)      cotton with wool and/or man-made fibers in
                                the aggregate equal or exceed 50 percent by
                                weight of the component fibers thereof and
                                the cotton component equals or exceeds the
                                weight of each of the total wool and/or
                                man-made fiber components, in which case it
                                shall be of cotton,

                                   Annex 300-B                              

                       (ii)     if not covered by subparagraph (i) and wool
                                exceeds 17 percent by weight of all
                                component fibers, in which case it shall be
                                of wool, or

                       (iii)    if not covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii)
                                and man-made fibers in combination with
                                cotton and/or wool in the aggregate equal
                                or exceed 50 percent by weight of the
                                component fibers thereof and the man-made
                                fiber component exceeds the weight of the
                                total wool and/or total cotton component,
                                in which case it shall be of man-made
                                fibers.

            For purposes of this paragraph, only the textile fibers in the
            component of the good that determines the tariff classification
            of the good are to be considered.


            C.  Schedules

                 To determine which HS provisions are contained in a U.S.
            category listed in the Schedules to this Appendix, the Parties
            shall refer to the Correlation: Textile and Apparel Categories

                 (b)   The annual TPL on imports from Canada into the

                       4 and 6 shall be monitored by the Parties.  On
                       request of any Party wishing to adjust any annual
                       TPL for imports into Canada from Mexico or the
                       United States, imports into Mexico from Canada or
                       the United States, or imports into the United
                       States from Mexico, based on the ability to obtain
                       supplies of particular fibers, yarns and fabrics,
                       as appropriate, that can be used to produce
                       originating goods, the Parties shall consult with a
                       view to adjusting such level.  Any adjustment in
                       the TPL requires the mutual consent of the Parties
                       concerned.

                 (b)   Canada and the United States shall decide, in the
                       review referred to in Section 7(3), whether to
                       continue to apply annual growth factors to the
                       specified TPLs after the five consecutive years. 
                       If a growth factor for a TPL is not continued as a
                       result of the review, subparagraph (a) shall also
                       apply to imports from Canada into the United States
                       of goods covered by the TPL.

                                    Rules of Origin 
 
 
            Article 401:   Originating Goods 
 
                 Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, a good shall 
            originate in the territory of a Party where: 
 
                 (a)  the good is wholly obtained or produced entirely in 
                      the territory of one or more of the Parties, as 
                      defined in Article 415; 
 
                 (b)  each of the non-originating materials used in the 
                      production of the good undergoes an applicable change 
                      in tariff classification set out in Annex 401 as a 
                      result of production occurring entirely in the 
                      territory of one or more of the Parties, or the good 
                      otherwise satisfies the applicable requirements of 
                      that Annex where no change in tariff classification 
                      is required, and the good satisfies all other 
                      applicable requirements of this Chapter; 
 
                 (c)  the good is produced entirely in the territory of one 
                      or more of the Parties exclusively from originating 
                      materials; or 
 
                 (d)  except for a good provided for in Chapters 61 through 
                      63 of the Harmonized System, the good is produced 
                      entirely in the territory of one or more of the 
                      Parties but one or more of the non-originating 
                      materials provided for as parts under the Harmonized 
                      System that are used in the production of the good 
                      does not undergo a change in tariff classification 
                      because 
 
                      (i)  the good was imported into the territory of a 
                           Party in an unassembled or a disassembled form 
                           but was classified as an assembled good pursuant 
                           to General Rule of Interpretation 2(a) of the 
                           Harmonized System, or  
 
                      (ii) the heading for the good provides for and 
                           specifically describes both the good itself and 
                           its parts and is not further subdivided into 
                           subheadings, or the subheading for the good 
                           provides for and specifically describes both the 
                           good itself and its parts, 
 
                      provided that the regional value content of the good, 
                      determined in accordance with Article 402, is not 
                      less than 60 percent where the transaction value 
                      method is used, or is not less than 50 percent where 
                      the net cost method is used, and that the good 
                      satisfies all other applicable requirements of this 
                      Chapter. 
 
 
            Article 402:   Regional Value Content 
 
            1.   Except as provided in paragraph 5, each Party shall 
            provide that the regional value content of a good shall be 
            calculated, at the choice of the exporter or producer of the 
            good, on the basis of either the transaction value method set 
            out in paragraph 2 or the net cost method set out in paragraph 
            3. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer may 
            calculate the regional value content of a good on the basis of 
            the following transaction value method: 
 
                                          TV - VNM 
                           RVC       =         -------------- x 100 
                                             TV 
 
                 where 
 
                           RVC       is the regional value content, 
                                     expressed as a percentage; 
 
                           TV        is the transaction value of the good 
                                     adjusted to a F.O.B. basis; and 
 
                           VNM  is the value of non-originating materials 
                                used by the producer in the production of 
                                the good.  
 
            3.   Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer may 
            calculate the regional value content of a good on the basis of 
            the following net cost method: 
 
 
                                          NC - VNM 
                           RVC       =    -------------- x 100   
                                             NC 
 
                 where 
 
                           RVC       is the regional value content, 
                                     expressed as a percentage; 
 
                           NC        is the net cost of the good; and 
 
                           VNM       is the value of non-originating 
                                     materials used by the producer in the 
                                     production of the good. 
 
            4.   Except as provided in Article 403(1) and (2)(a)(i), the 
            value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the 
            production of a good shall not, for purposes of calculating the 
            regional value content of the good under paragraph 2 or 3, 
            include the value of non-originating materials used to produce 
            originating materials that are subsequently used in the 
            production of the good. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer 
            shall calculate the regional value content of a good solely on 
            the basis of the net cost method set out in paragraph 3 where:  
 
                 (a)  there is no transaction value for the good;  
 
                 (b)  the transaction value of the good is unacceptable 
                      under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code; 
 
                 (c)  the good is sold by the producer to a related person 
                      and the volume, by units of quantity, of sales of 
                      identical or similar goods to related persons during 
                      the six-month period immediately preceding the month 
                      in which the good is sold exceeds 85 percent of the 
                      producer's total sales of such goods during that 
                      period; 
 
                 (d)  the good is 
 
                      (i)  a motor vehicle provided for in heading 87.01 or 
                           87.02, subheading 8703.21 through 8703.90, or 
                           heading 87.04, 87.05 or 87.06, 
 
                      (ii) identified in Annex 403.1 or 403.2 and is for 
                           use in a motor vehicle provided for in heading 
                           87.01 or 87.02, subheading 8703.21 through 
                           8703.90, or heading 87.04, 87.05 or 87.06, 
 
                      (iii)     provided for in subheading 6401.10 through 
                                6406.10, or  
 
                      (iv) provided for in tariff item 8469.10.aa (word 
                           processing machines);  
 
                 (e)  the exporter or producer chooses to accumulate the 
                      regional value content of the good in accordance with 
                      Article 404; or 
   
                 (f)  the good is designated as an intermediate material 
                      under paragraph 10 and is subject to a regional 
                      value-content requirement. 
 
            6.   If an exporter or producer of a good calculates the 
            regional value content of the good on the basis of the 
            transaction value method set out in paragraph 2 and a Party 
            subsequently notifies the exporter or producer, during the 
            course of a verification pursuant to Chapter Five (Customs 
            Procedures), that the transaction value of the good, or the 
            value of any material used in the production of the good, is 
            required to be adjusted or is unacceptable under Article 1 of 
            the Customs Valuation Code, the exporter or producer may then 
            also calculate the regional value content of the good on the 
            basis of the net cost method set out in paragraph 3. 
 
            7.   Nothing in paragraph 6 shall be construed to prevent any 
            review or appeal available under Article 510 (Review and 
            Appeal) of an adjustment to or a rejection of: 
 
                 (a)  the transaction value of a good; or 
 
                 (b)  the value of any material used in the production of a 
                      good. 
 
            8.   For purposes of calculating the net cost of a good under 
            paragraph 3, the producer of the good may: 
 
                 (a)  calculate the total cost incurred with respect to all 
                      goods produced by that producer, subtract any sales 
                      promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, 
                      royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non- 
                      allowable interest costs that are included in the 
                      total cost of all such goods, and then reasonably 
                      allocate the resulting net cost of those goods to the 
                      good,  
 
                 (b)  calculate the total cost incurred with respect to all 
                      goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocate 
                      the total cost to the good, and then subtract any 
                      sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service 
                      costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs and non- 
                      allowable interest costs that are included in the 
                      portion of the total cost allocated to the good, or 
 
                 (c)  reasonably allocate each cost that forms part of the 
                      total cost incurred with respect to the good so that 
                      the aggregate of these costs does not include any 
                      sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service 
                      costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and 
                      non-allowable interest costs,  
 
            provided that the allocation of all such costs is consistent 
            with the provisions regarding the reasonable allocation of 
            costs set out in the Uniform Regulations, established under 
            Article 511 (Customs Procedures - Uniform Regulations). 
 
            9.   Except as provided in paragraph 11, the value of a 
            material used in the production of a good shall: 
 
                 (a)  be the transaction value of the material determined 
                      in accordance with Article 1 of the Customs Valuation 
                      Code; or 
 
                 (b)  in the event that there is no transaction value or 
                      the transaction value of the material is unacceptable 
                      under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, be 
                      determined in accordance with Articles 2 through 7 of 
                      the Customs Valuation Code; and 
 
                 (c)  where not included under subparagraph (a) or (b), 
                      include  
 
                      (i)  freight, insurance, packing and all other costs 
                           incurred in transporting the material to the 
                           location of the producer,  
 
                      (ii) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the 
                           material paid in the territory of one or more of 
                           the Parties, and 
 
                      (iii)     the cost of waste and spoilage resulting 
                                from the use of the material in the 
                                production of the good, less the value of 
                                renewable scrap or by-product. 
 
            10.  Except as provided in Article 403(1) and for a component 
            identified in Annex 403.2, the producer of a good may, for 
            purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good 
            under paragraph 2 or 3, designate any self-produced material 
            used in the production of the good as an intermediate material, 
            provided that where the intermediate material is subject to a 
            regional value-content requirement, no other self-produced 
            material subject to a regional value-content requirement used 
            in the production of that intermediate material may itself be 
            designated by the producer as an intermediate material. 
 
            11.  The value of an intermediate material shall be: 
 
                 (a)  the total cost incurred with respect to all goods 
                      produced by the producer of the good that can be 
                      reasonably allocated to that intermediate material; 
                      or 
 
                 (b)  the aggregate of each cost that forms part of the 
                      total cost incurred with respect to that intermediate 
                      material that can be reasonably allocated to that 
                      intermediate material. 
 
            12.  The value of an indirect material shall be based on the 
            Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the 
            territory of the Party in which the good is produced. 
 
 
            Article 403:   Automotive Goods 
 
            1.   For purposes of calculating the regional value content 
            under the net cost method set out in Article 402(3) for: 
 
                 (a)  a good that is a motor vehicle provided for in tariff 
                      item 8702.10.bb or 8702.90.bb (vehicles for the 
                      transport of 15 or fewer persons), or subheading 
                      8703.21 through 8703.90, 8704.21 or 8704.31, or 
 
                 (b)  a good provided for in the tariff provisions listed 
                      in Annex 403.1 where the good is subject to a 
                      regional value-content requirement and is for use as 
                      original equipment in the production of a good 
                      provided for in tariff item 8702.10.bb or 8702.90.bb 
                      (vehicles for the transport of 15 or fewer persons), 
                      or subheading 8702.xx, 8703.21 through 8703.90, 
                      8704.21 or 8704.31,  
 
            the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in 
            the production of the good shall be the sum of the values of 
            non-originating materials, determined in accordance with 
            Article 402(9) at the time the non-originating materials are 
            received by the first person in the territory of a Party who 
            takes title to them, that are imported from outside the 
            territories of the Parties under the tariff provisions listed 
            in Annex 403.1 and that are used in the production of the good 
            or that are used in the production of any material used in the 
            production of the good. 
 
            2.   For purposes of calculating the regional value content 
            under the net cost method set out in Article 402(3) for a good 
            that is a motor vehicle provided for in heading 87.01, tariff 
            item 8702.10.aa or 8702.90.aa (vehicles for the transport of 16 
            or more persons), subheading 8704.10, 8704.22, 8704.23, 8704.32 
            or 8704.90, or heading 87.05 or 87.06, or for a component 
            identified in Annex 403.2 for use as original equipment in the 
            production of the motor vehicle, the value of non-originating 
            materials used by the producer in the production of the good 
            shall be the sum of: 
 
                  (a)  for each material used by the producer listed in 
                      Annex 403.2, whether or not produced by the producer, 
                      at the choice of the producer and determined in 
                      accordance with Article 402, either 
 
                      (i)  the value of such material that is non- 
                           originating, or 
 
                      (ii) the value of non-originating materials used in 
                           the production of such material; and 
 
                 (b)  the value of any other non-originating material used 
                      by the producer that is not listed in Annex 403.2, 
                      determined in accordance with Article 402. 
 
            3.   For purposes of calculating the regional value content of 
            a motor vehicle identified in paragraph 1 or 2, the producer 
            may average its calculation over its fiscal year, using any one 
            of the following categories, on the basis of either all motor 
            vehicles in the category or only those motor vehicles in the 
            category that are exported to the territory of one or more of 
            the other Parties:  
 
                 (a)  the same model line of motor vehicles in the same 
                      class of vehicles produced in the same plant in the 
                      territory of a Party;  
 
                 (b)  the same class of motor vehicles produced in the same 
                      plant in the territory of a Party;  
 
                 (c)  the same model line of motor vehicles produced in the 
                      territory of a Party; or 
 
                 (d)  if applicable, the basis set out in Annex 403.3. 
 
            4.   For purposes of calculating the regional value content for

            Annex 403.1, or a component or material identified in Annex 
            403.2, produced in the same plant, the producer of the good 
            may: 
 
                 (a)  average its calculation 
 
                      (i)  over the fiscal year of the motor vehicle

            Article 404:   Accumulation 
 
            1.   For purposes of determining whether a good is an 
            originating good, the production of the good in the territory 
            of one or more of the Parties by one or more producers shall, 
            at the choice of the exporter or producer of the good for which 
            preferential tariff treatment is claimed, be considered to have 
            been performed in the territory of any of the Parties by that 
            exporter or producer, provided that: 
 
                 (a)  all non-originating materials used in the production 
                      of the good undergo an applicable tariff 
                      classification change set out in Annex 401, and the 
                      good satisfies any applicable regional value-content 
                      requirement, entirely in the territory of one or more 
                      of the Parties; and 
 
                  (b)  the good satisfies all other applicable requirements 
                      of this Chapter. 
 
            2.   For purposes of Article 402(10), the production of a 
            producer that chooses to accumulate its production with that of 
            other producers under paragraph 1 shall be considered to be the 
            production of a single producer. 
 
 
            Article 405:   De Minimis 
 
            1.   Except as provided in paragraphs 3 through 6, a good shall 
            be considered to be an originating good if the value of all 
            non-originating materials used in the production of the good 
            that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff 
            classification set out in Annex 401 is not more than seven 
            percent of the transaction value of the good, adjusted to a 
            F.O.B. basis, or, if the transaction value of the good is 
            unacceptable under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, the 
            value of all such non-originating materials is not more than 
            seven percent of the total cost of the good, provided that: 
 
                 (a)  if the good is subject to a regional value-content 
                      requirement, the value of such non-originating 
                      materials shall be taken into account in calculating 
                      the regional value content of the good; and 
 
                 (b)  the good satisfies all other applicable requirements 
                      of this Chapter. 
 
            2.   A good that is otherwise subject to a regional value- 
            content requirement shall not be required to satisfy such 
            requirement if the value of all non-originating materials used 
            in the production of the good is not more than seven percent of 
            the transaction value of the good, adjusted to a F.O.B. basis, 
            or, if the transaction value of the good is unacceptable under 
            Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, the value of all non- 
            originating materials is not more than seven percent of the 
            total cost of the good, provided that the good satisfies all 
            other applicable requirements of this Chapter. 
 
            3.   Paragraph 1 does not apply to:  
 
                 (a)  a non-originating material provided for in Chapter 4

            material is provided for in a different subheading than the 
            good for which origin is being determined under this Article. 
 
            6.   A good provided for in Chapter 50 through 63 of the 
            Harmonized System that does not originate because certain 
            fibers or yarns used in the production of the component of the 
            good that determines the tariff classification of the good do 
            not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set 
            out in Annex 401, shall nonetheless be considered to originate 
            if the total weight of all such fibers or yarns in that 
            component is not more than seven percent of the total weight of 
            that component. 
 
 
            Article 406:   Fungible Goods and Materials 
 
                 For purposes of determining whether a good is an 
            originating good:  
 
                 (a)  where originating and non-originating fungible 
                      materials are used in the production of a good, the 
                      determination of whether the materials are 
                      originating need not be made through the 
                      identification of any specific fungible material, 
                      but may be determined on the basis of any of the 
                      inventory management methods set out in the Uniform 
                      Regulations; and 
 
                 (b)  where originating and non-originating fungible goods 
                      are commingled and exported in the same form, the 
                      determination may be made on the basis of any of the 
                      inventory management methods set out in the Uniform 
                      Regulations. 
 
 
            Article 407:   Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools 
 
                 Accessories, spare parts or tools delivered with the good 
            that form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts, 
            or tools, shall be considered as originating if the good 
            originates and shall be disregarded in determining whether all 
            the non-originating materials used in the production of the

                      (iii)     the definitions in Article 415 shall take 
                                precedence over the definitions in the 
                                Customs Valuation Code to the extent of any 
                                difference; and

                      Regional Value-Content Calculation for CAMI 
 
 
            1.   For purposes of Article 403, in determining whether motor 
            vehicles produced by CAMI Automotive, Inc. ("CAMI") in the 
            territory of Canada and imported into the territory of the 
            United States qualify as originating goods, CAMI may average 
            its calculation of the regional value content of a class of 
            motor vehicles or a model line of motor vehicles produced in a 
            fiscal year in the territory of Canada by CAMI for sale in the 
            territory of one or more of the Parties with the calculation of 
            the regional value content of the corresponding class of motor 
            vehicles or model line of motor vehicles produced in the 
            territory of Canada by General Motors of Canada Limited in the 
            fiscal year that corresponds most closely to CAMI's fiscal 
            year, provided that:  
 
                 (a)  at the beginning of CAMI's fiscal year General Motors 
                      of Canada Limited owns 50 percent or more of the 
                      voting common stock of CAMI; and 
 
                 (b)  General Motors of Canada Limited, General Motors 
                      Corporation, General Motors de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., 
                      and any subsidiary directly or indirectly owned by 
                      any of them, or by any combination thereof, ("GM") 
                      acquires 75 percent or more by unit of quantity of 
                      the class of motor vehicles or model line of motor 
                      vehicles, as the case may be, that CAMI has produced 
                      in the territory of Canada in CAMI's fiscal year for 
                      sale in the territory of one or more of the Parties. 
 
            2.   If GM acquires less than 75 percent by unit of quantity of 
            the class of motor vehicles or model line of motor vehicles, as 
            the case may be, that CAMI has produced in the territory of 
            Canada in CAMI's fiscal year for sale in the territory of one 
            or more of the Parties, CAMI may average in the manner set out 
            in paragraph 1 only those motor vehicles that are acquired by 
            GM for distribution under the GEO marque or other GM marque. 
 
            3.   In calculating the regional value content of motor 
            vehicles produced by CAMI in the territory of Canada, CAMI may 
            choose to average the calculation in paragraph 1 or 2 over a 
            period of two fiscal years in the event that any motor vehicle 
            assembly plant operated by CAMI or any motor vehicle assembly 
            plant operated by General Motors of Canada Limited with which 
 
                            Annex 403.3                                     

            CAMI is averaging its regional value content is closed for more 
            than two consecutive months: 
 
                 (a)  for the purpose of re-tooling for a model change, or 
 
                 (b)  as the result of any event or circumstance (other 
                      than the imposition of antidumping and countervailing 
                      duties, or an interruption of operations resulting 
                      from a labor strike, lock-out, labor dispute, 
                      picketing or boycott of or by employees of CAMI or 
                      GM), that CAMI or GM could not reasonably have been 
                      expected to avert by corrective action or by exercise 
                      of due care and diligence, including a shortage of 
                      materials, failure of utilities, or inability to 
                      obtain or delay in obtaining raw materials, parts, 
                      fuel or utilities. 
 
            The averaging may be for CAMI's fiscal year in which a CAMI or 
            any General Motors of Canada Limited plant with which CAMI is 
            averaging is closed and either the previous or subsequent 
            fiscal year.  In the event that the period of closure spans two 
            fiscal years, the averaging may be only for those two fiscal 
            years. 
 
            4.   For purposes of this Article, where as a result of an 
            amalgamation, reorganization, division or similar transaction: 
 
                 (a)  a motor vehicle producer (the "successor producer") 
                      acquires all or substantially all of the assets used 
                      by GM, and 
 
                 (b)  the successor producer, directly or indirectly 
                      controls, or is controlled by, GM, or both the 
                      successor producer and GM are controlled by the same 
                      person, 
 
            the successor producer shall be deemed to be GM.

                      good for which an importer may claim preferential 
                      tariff treatment on importation of the good into the 
                      territory of another Party; and 
 
                 (b)  provide that where an exporter in its territory is 
                      not the producer of the good, the exporter may 
                      complete and sign a Certificate on the basis of 
 
                      (i)  its knowledge of whether the good qualifies as 
                           an originating good,  
 
                      (ii) its reasonable reliance on the producer's 
                           written representation that the good qualifies 
                           as an originating good, or 
 
                      (iii)     a completed and signed Certificate for the 
                                good voluntarily provided to the exporter 
                                by the producer. 
 
            4.   Nothing in paragraph 3 shall be construed to require a 
            producer to provide a Certificate of Origin to an exporter. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall provide that a Certificate of Origin that 
            has been completed and signed by an exporter or a producer in 
            the territory of another Party that is applicable to: 
 
                 (a)  a single importation of a good into the Party's 
                      territory, or 
 
                 (b)  multiple importations of identical goods into the 
                      Party's territory that occur within a specified 
                      period, not exceeding 12 months, set out therein by 
                      the exporter or producer, 
 
            shall be accepted by its customs administration for four years 
            after the date on which the Certificate was signed. 
 
 
            Article 502:   Obligations Regarding Importations 
 
            1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each Party 
            shall require an importer in its territory that claims 
            preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into its 
            territory from the territory of another Party to: 
 
                 (a)  make a written declaration, based on a valid 
                      Certificate of Origin, that the good qualifies as an 
                      originating good; 
 
                 (b)  have the Certificate in its possession at the time 
                      the declaration is made; 
 
                 (c)  provide, on the request of that Party's customs 
                      administration, a copy of the Certificate; and 
 
                 (d)  promptly make a corrected declaration and pay any 
                      duties owing where the importer has reason to believe 
                      that a Certificate on which a declaration was based 
                      contains information that is not correct. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide that, where an importer in its 
            territory claims preferential tariff treatment for a good 
            imported into its territory from the territory of another 
            Party: 
 
                 (a)  the Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to 
                      the good if the importer fails to comply with any 
                      requirement under this Chapter; and 
 
                 (b)  the importer shall not be subject to penalties for 
                      the making of an incorrect declaration, if it 
                      voluntarily makes a corrected declaration pursuant to 
                      paragraph 1(d). 
 
            3.   Each Party shall provide that, where a good would have 
            qualified as an originating good when it was imported into the 
            territory of that Party but no claim for preferential tariff 
            treatment was made at that time, the importer of the good may, 
            no later than one year after the date on which the good was 
            imported, apply for a refund of any excess duties paid as the 
            result of the good not having been accorded preferential tariff 
            treatment, on presentation of: 
 
                 (a)  a written declaration that the good qualified as an 
                      originating good at the time of importation;  
 
                 (b)  a copy of the Certificate of Origin; and  
 
                 (c)  such other documentation relating to the importation 
                      of the good as that Party may require. 
 
 
            Article 503:   Exceptions  
 
                 Each Party shall provide that a Certificate of Origin 
            shall not be required for: 
 
                 (a)  a commercial importation of a good whose value does 
                      not exceed US$1,000 or its equivalent amount in the 
                      Party's currency, or such higher amount as it may 
                      establish, except that it may require that the 
                      invoice accompanying the importation include a 
                      statement certifying that the good qualifies as an 
                      originating good,  
 
                 (b)  a non-commercial importation of a good whose value 
                      does not exceed US$1,000 or its equivalent amount in 
                      the Party's currency, or such higher amount as it may 
                      establish, or 
 
                 (c)  an importation of a good for which the Party into 
                      whose territory the good is imported has waived the 
                      requirement for a Certificate of Origin, 
 
            provided that the importation does not form part of a series of 
            importations that may reasonably be considered to have been 
            undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the 
            certification requirements of Articles 501 and 502. 
 
 
            Article 504:   Obligations Regarding Exportations  
 
            1.   Each Party shall provide that: 
 
                 (a)  an exporter in its territory, or a producer in its 
                      territory that has provided a copy of a Certificate 
                      of Origin to that exporter pursuant to Article 
                      501(3)(b)(iii), shall provide a copy of the 
                      Certificate to its customs administration on request; 
                      and 
 
                 (b)  an exporter or a producer in its territory that has 
                      completed and signed a Certificate of Origin, and 
                      that has reason to believe that the Certificate 
                      contains information that is not correct, shall 
                      promptly notify in writing all persons to whom the 
                      Certificate was given by the exporter or producer of 
                      any change that could affect the accuracy or validity 
                      of the Certificate. 
 
            2.   Each Party: 
 
                 (a)  shall provide that a false certification by an 
                      exporter or a producer in its territory that a good 
                      to be exported to the territory of another Party 
                      qualifies as an originating good shall have the same 
                      legal consequences, with appropriate modifications, 
                      as would apply to an importer in its territory for a 
                      contravention of its customs laws and regulations 
                      regarding the making of a false statement or 
                      representation; and 
 
                 (b)  may apply such measures as the circumstances may 
                      warrant where an exporter or a producer in its 
                      territory fails to comply with any requirement of 
                      this Chapter. 
 
            3.   No Party may impose penalties on an exporter or a producer 
            in its territory that voluntarily provides written notification 
            pursuant to paragraph (1)(b) with respect to the making of an 
            incorrect certification. 
 
 
                       Section B - Administration and Enforcement 
 
 
            Article 505:   Records 
 
                 Each Party shall provide that: 
 
                 (a)  an exporter or a producer in its territory that 
                      completes and signs a Certificate of Origin shall 
                      maintain in its territory, for five years after the 
                      date on which the Certificate was signed or for such 
                      longer period as the Party may specify, all records 
                      relating to the origin of a good for which 
                      preferential tariff treatment was claimed in the 
                      territory of another Party, including records 
                      associated with 
  
                      (i)  the purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment 
                           for, the good that is exported from its 
                           territory, 
 
                      (ii) the purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment 
                           for, all materials, including indirect 
                           materials, used in the production of the good 
                           that is exported from its territory, and 
 
                      (iii)     the production of the good in the form in 
                                which the good is exported from its 
                                territory; and 
 
                 (b)  an importer claiming preferential tariff treatment 
                      for a good imported into the Party's territory shall 
                      maintain in that territory, for five years after the 
                      date of importation of the good or for such longer 
                      period as the Party may specify, such documentation, 
                      including a copy of the Certificate, as the Party may 
                      require relating to the importation of the good. 
 
 
            Article 506:   Origin Verifications 
 
            1.   For purposes of determining whether a good imported into 
            its territory from the territory of another Party qualifies as 
            an originating good, a Party may, through its customs 
            administration, conduct a verification solely by means of: 
 
                 (a)  written questionnaires to an exporter or a producer 
                      in the territory of another Party;  
 
                 (b)  visits to the premises of an exporter or a producer 
                      in the territory of another Party to review the 
                      records referred to in Article 505(a) and observe the 
                      facilities used in the production of the good; or 
 
                 (c)  such other procedure as the Parties may agree. 
 
            2.   Prior to conducting a verification visit pursuant to 
            paragraph (1)(b), a Party shall, through its customs 
            administration: 
 
                 (a)  deliver a written notification of its intention to 
                      conduct the visit to 
 
                      (i)  the exporter or producer whose premises are to 
                           be visited, 
 
                      (ii) the customs administration of the Party in whose 
                           territory the visit is to occur, and 
 
                      (iii)     if requested by the Party in whose 
                                territory the visit is to occur, the 
                                embassy of that Party in the territory of 
                                the Party proposing to conduct the visit; 
                                and 
 
                 (b)  obtain the written consent of the exporter or 
                      producer whose premises are to be visited. 
 
            3.   The notification referred to in paragraph 2 shall include: 
 
                 (a)  the identity of the customs administration issuing 
                      the notification; 
 
                 (b)  the name of the exporter or producer whose premises 
                      are to be visited; 
 
                 (c)  the date and place of the proposed verification 
                      visit; 
 
                 (d)  the object and scope of the proposed verification 
                      visit, including specific reference to the good that 
                      is the subject of the verification; 
 
                 (e)  the names and titles of the officials performing the 
                      verification visit; and 
 
                 (f)  the legal authority for the verification visit. 
              
            4.   Where an exporter or a producer has not given its written 
            consent to a proposed verification visit within 30 days of 
            receipt of notification pursuant to paragraph 2, the notifying 
            Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that 
            would have been the subject of the visit. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall provide that, where its customs 
            administration receives notification pursuant to paragraph 2, 
            the customs administration may, within 15 days of receipt of 
            the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for 
            a period not exceeding 60 days from the date of such receipt, 
            or for such longer period as the Parties may agree. 
 
            6.   A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a 
            good based solely on the postponement of a verification visit 
            pursuant to paragraph 5. 
 
            7.   Each Party shall permit an exporter or a producer whose 
            good is the subject of a verification visit by another Party to 
            designate two observers to be present during the visit, 
            provided that: 
 
                  (a)  the observers do not participate in a manner other 
                      than as observers; and 
 
                 (b)  the failure of the exporter or producer to designate 
                      observers shall not result in the postponement of the 
                      visit. 
 
            8.   Each Party shall, through its customs administration, 
            conduct a verification of a regional value-content requirement 
            in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
            applied in the territory of the Party from which the good was 
            exported. 
 
            9.   The Party conducting a verification shall provide the 
            exporter or producer whose good is the subject of the 
            verification with a written determination of whether the good 
            qualifies as an originating good, including findings of fact 
            and the legal basis for the determination. 
 
            10.  Where verifications by a Party indicate a pattern of 
            conduct by an exporter or a producer of false or unsupported 
            representations that a good imported into its territory 
            qualifies as an originating good, the Party may withhold 
            preferential tariff treatment to identical goods exported or 
            produced by such person until that person establishes 
            compliance with Chapter Four (Rules of Origin). 
 
            11.  Each Party shall provide that where it determines that a 
            certain good imported into its territory does not qualify as an 
            originating good based on a tariff classification or a value 
            applied by the Party to one or more materials used in the 
            production of the good, which differs from the tariff 
            classification or value applied to the materials by the Party 
            from whose territory the good was exported, the Party's 
            determination shall not become effective until it notifies in 
            writing both the importer of the good and the person that 
            completed and signed the Certificate of Origin for the good of 
            its determination. 
 
            12.  A Party shall not apply a determination made under 
            paragraph 11 to an importation made before the effective date 
            of the determination where: 
 
                 (a)  the customs administration of the Party from whose 
                      territory the good was exported has issued an advance 
                      ruling on the tariff classification or on the value 
                      of such materials, or has given consistent treatment 
                      to the entry of the materials under the tariff 
                      classification or value at issue, on which a person 
                      is entitled to rely; and 
 
                  (b)  the advance ruling or consistent treatment was given 
                      prior to notification of the determination. 
 
            13.  If a Party denies preferential tariff treatment to a good 
            pursuant to a determination made under paragraph 11, it shall 
            postpone the effective date of the denial for a period not 
            exceeding 90 days where the importer of the good, or the person 
            who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin for the 
            good, demonstrates that it has relied in good faith to its 
            detriment on the tariff classification or value applied to such 
            materials by the customs administration of the Party from whose 
            territory the good was exported. 
 
 
            Article 507:   Confidentiality 
 
            1.   Each Party shall maintain, in accordance with its law, the 
            confidentiality of confidential business information collected 
            pursuant to this Chapter and shall protect that information 
            from disclosure that could prejudice the competitive position

            civil or administrative penalties for violations of its laws

            Articles 509:  Advance Rulings 
 
            1.   Each Party shall, through its customs administration, 
            provide for the expeditious issuance of written advance 
            rulings, prior to the importation of a good into its territory, 
            to an importer in its territory or an exporter or a producer in 
            the territory of another Party, on the basis of the facts and 
            circumstances presented by such importer, exporter or producer 
            of the good, concerning: 
 
                  (a)  whether materials imported from a non-Party used in 
                      the production of a good undergo an applicable change 
                      in tariff classification set out in Annex 401 as a 
                      result of production occurring entirely in the 
                      territory of one or more of the Parties; 
 
                 (b)  whether a good satisfies a regional value-content 
                      requirement under either the transaction value method 
                      or the net cost method set out in Chapter Four; 
 
                 (c)  for the purpose of determining whether a good 
                      satisfies a regional value-content requirement under 
                      Chapter Four, the appropriate basis or method for 
                      value to be applied by an exporter or a producer in 
                      the territory of another Party, in accordance with 
                      the principles of the Customs Valuation Code, for 
                      calculating the transaction value of the good or of 
                      the materials used in the production of the good; 
 
                 (d)  for the purpose of determining whether a good 
                      satisfies a regional value-content requirement under 
                      Chapter Four, the appropriate basis or method for 
                      reasonably allocating costs, in accordance with the 
                      allocation methods set out in the Uniform 
                      Regulations, for calculating the net cost of the good 
                      or the value of an intermediate material; 
 
                 (e)  whether a good qualifies as an originating good under 
                      Chapter Four; 
 
                 (f)  whether a good that re-enters its territory after the 
                      good has been exported from its territory to the 
                      territory of another Party for repair or alteration 
                      qualifies for duty-free treatment in accordance with 
                      Article 307 (Goods Re-Entered after Repair or 
                      Alteration);  
 
                 (g)  whether the proposed or actual marking of a good 
                      satisfies country of origin marking requirements 
                      under Article 311 (Country of Origin Marking);  
 
                 (h)  whether an originating good qualifies as a good of a 
                      Party under Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods), 
                      Annex 302.2 (Tariff Elimination) or Chapter Seven 
                      (Agriculture and Sanitary and Phytosanitary 
                      Measures); 
 
                 (i)  whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter 
                      Seven; or 
 
                 (j)  such other matters as the Parties may agree. 
 
  
            2.   Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures for the 
            issuance of advance rulings, including a detailed description 
            of the information reasonably required to process an 
            application for a ruling. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall provide that its customs administration: 
 
                 (a)  may, at any time during the course of an evaluation 
                      of an application for an advance ruling, request 
                      supplemental information from the person requesting 
                      the ruling;  
 
                 (b)  shall, after it has obtained all necessary 
                      information from the person requesting an advance 
                      ruling, issue the ruling within the periods specified 
                      in the Uniform Regulations; and 
 
                 (c)  shall, where the advance ruling is unfavorable to the 
                      person requesting it, provide to that person a full 
                      explanation of the reasons for the ruling. 
 
            4.   Subject to paragraph 6, each Party shall apply an advance 
            ruling to importations into its territory of the good for which 
            the ruling was requested, beginning on the date of its issuance 
            or such later date as may be specified in the ruling. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall provide to any person requesting an 
            advance ruling the same treatment, including the same 
            interpretation and application of provisions of Chapter Four 
            regarding a determination of origin, as it provided to any 
            other person to whom it issued an advance ruling, provided that 
            the facts and circumstances are identical in all material 
            respects. 
 
            6.   The issuing Party may modify or revoke an advance ruling: 
 
                 (a)  if the ruling is based on an error 
 
                      (i)  of fact, 
 
                      (ii) in the tariff classification of a good or a

                      (iii)     in the application of a regional value- 
                                content requirement under Chapter Four, 
 
                      (iv) in the application of the rules for determining 
                           whether a good qualifies as a good of a Party 
                           under Annex 300-B, 302.2 or Chapter Seven, 
 
                      (v)  in the application of the rules for determining 
                           whether a good is a qualifying good under 
                           Chapter Seven, or 
 
                      (vi) in the application of the rules for determining 
                           whether a good that re-enters its territory 
                           after the good has been exported from its 
                           territory to the territory of another Party for 
                           repair or alteration qualifies for duty-free 
                           treatment under Article 307; 
 
                 (b)  if the ruling is not in accordance with an 
                      interpretation agreed by the Parties regarding 
                      Chapter Three (National Treatment and Market Access 
                      for Goods) or Chapter Four; 
 
                 (c)  if there is a change in the material facts or 
                      circumstances on which the ruling is based;  
 
                 (d)  to conform with a modification of Chapter Three, 
                      Chapter Four, this Chapter, Chapter Seven, the 
                      Marking Rules or the Uniform Regulations; or 
 
                 (e)  to conform with a judicial decision or a change in 
                      its domestic law. 
 
            7.   Each Party shall provide that any modification or 
            revocation of an advance ruling shall be effective on the date 
            on which the modification or revocation is issued, or on such 
            later date as may be specified therein, and shall not be 
            applied to importations of a good that have occurred prior to 
            that date, unless the person to whom the advance ruling was 
            issued has not acted in accordance with its terms and 
            conditions.  
 
            8.   Notwithstanding paragraph 7, the issuing Party shall 
            postpone the effective date of such modification or revocation 
            for a period not exceeding 90 days where the person to whom the 
            advance ruling was issued has relied in good faith to its 
            detriment on that ruling. 
 
            9.   Each Party shall provide that where its customs 
            administration examines the regional value content of a good 
            for which it has issued an advance ruling pursuant to 
            subparagraph 1(c), (d) or (f), it shall evaluate whether: 
 
                 (a)  the exporter or producer has complied with the terms 
                      and conditions of the advance ruling; 
 
                 (b)  the exporter's or producer's operations are 
                      consistent with the material facts and circumstances 
                      on which the advance ruling is based; and 
 
                 (c)  the supporting data and computations used in applying 
                      the basis or method for calculating value or 
                      allocating cost were correct in all material 
                      respects. 
 
            10.  Each Party shall provide that where its customs 
            administration determines that any requirement in paragraph 9 
            has not been satisfied, it may modify or revoke the advance 
            ruling as the circumstances may warrant.  
 
            11.  Each Party shall provide that, where the person to whom an 
            advance ruling was issued demonstrates that it used reasonable 
            care and acted in good faith in presenting the facts and 
            circumstances on which the ruling was based, and where the 
            customs administration of a Party determines that the ruling 
            was based on incorrect information, the person to whom the 
            ruling was issued shall not be subject to penalties. 
 
            12.  Each Party shall provide that where it issues an advance 
            ruling to a person that has misrepresented or omitted material 
            facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based or has 
            failed to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
            the ruling, the Party may apply such measures as the 
            circumstances may warrant.

            Advance Rulings

            2.   Further to Articles 1804 (Administrative Proceedings) and 
            1805 (Review and Appeal), each Party shall provide that the 
            rights of review and appeal referred to in paragraph 1 shall 
            include access to: 
 
                 (a)  at least one level of administrative review 
                      independent of the official or office responsible for

            Parties agree on such modification or addition, or such other 
            period as the Parties may agree.

            Group or the Customs Subgroup or from taking such other action

                                      Chapter Six 
 
                            Energy and Basic Petrochemicals 
 
 
            Article 601:   Principles 
 
            1.   The Parties confirm their full respect for their 
            Constitutions. 
 
            2.   The Parties recognize that it is desirable to strengthen 
            the important role that trade in energy and basic petrochemical 
            goods plays in the free trade area and to enhance this role 
            through sustained and gradual liberalization. 
 
            3.   The Parties recognize the importance of having viable and 
            internationally competitive energy and petrochemical sectors to 
            further their individual national interests. 
 
 
            Article 602:   Scope and Coverage 
 
            1.   This Chapter applies to measures relating to energy and 
            basic petrochemical goods originating in the territories of the 
            Parties and to measures relating to investment and to the 
            cross-border trade in services associated with such goods, as 
            set forth in this Chapter. 
 
            2.   For purposes of this Chapter, energy and basic 
            petrochemical goods refer to those goods classified under the 
            Harmonized System as: 
 
                 (a)  subheading 2612.10; 
 
                 (b)  headings 27.01 through 27.06; 
 
                 (c)  subheading 2707.50; 
 
                 (d)  subheading 2707.99 (only with respect to solvent 
                      naphtha, rubber extender oils and carbon black 
                      feedstocks); 
 
                 (e)  headings 27.08 and 27.09; 
 
                 (f)  heading 27.10 (except for normal paraffin mixtures in 
                      the range of C9 to C15); 
 
                 (g)  heading 27.11 (except for ethylene, propylene, 
                      butylene and butadiene in purities over 50 percent); 
 
                 (h)  headings 27.12 through 27.16; 
 
                 (i)  subheadings 2844.10 through 2844.50 (only with 
                      respect to uranium compounds classified under those 
                      subheadings); 
 
                 (j)  subheading 2845.10; and 
 
                 (k)  subheading 2901.10 (only with respect to ethane, 
                      butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and heptanes). 
 
            3.   Except as specified in Annex 602.3, energy and 
            petrochemical goods and activities shall be governed by the 
            provisions of this Agreement.  
 
 
            Article 603:   Import and Export Restrictions 
 
            1.   Subject to the further rights and obligations of this 
            Agreement, the Parties incorporate the provisions of the 
            General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), with respect to 
            prohibitions or restrictions on trade in energy and basic 
            petrochemical goods.  The Parties agree that this language does 
            not incorporate their respective protocols of provisional 
            application to the GATT.  
 
            2.   The Parties understand that the provisions of the GATT 
            incorporated in paragraph 1 prohibit, in any circumstances in 
            which any other form of quantitative restriction is prohibited, 
            minimum or maximum export-price requirements and, except as 
            permitted in enforcement of countervailing and antidumping 
            orders and undertakings, minimum or maximum import-price 
            requirements. 
 
            3.   In circumstances where a Party adopts or maintains a 
            restriction on importation from or exportation to a non-Party 
            of an energy or basic petrochemical good, nothing in this 
            Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Party from: 
 
                 (a)  limiting or prohibiting the importation from the 
                      territory of any Party of such energy or basic 
                      petrochemical good of the non-Party; or 
 
                 (b)  requiring as a condition of export of such energy or 
                      basic petrochemical good of the Party to the 
                      territory of any other Party that the good be 
                      consumed within the territory of the other Party. 
 
            4.   In the event that a Party adopts or maintains a 
            restriction on imports of an energy or basic petrochemical good 
            from non-Party countries, the Parties, on request of any Party, 
            shall consult with a view to avoiding undue interference with 
            or distortion of pricing, marketing and distribution 
            arrangements in another Party. 
 
            5.   Each Party may administer a system of import and export 
            licensing for energy or  basic petrochemical goods provided 
            that such system is operated in a manner consistent with the 
            provisions of this Agreement, including paragraph 1 and Article 
            1502 (Monopolies and State Enterprises). 
 
            6.   This Article is subject to the reservations set out in 
            Annex 603.6. 
 
 
            Article 604:   Export Taxes 
 
                 No Party may adopt or maintain any duty, tax or other 
            charge on the export of any energy or basic petrochemical good 
            to the territory of another Party, unless such duty, tax or 
            charge is adopted or maintained on: 
 
                 (a)  exports of any such good to the territory of all 
                      other Parties; and 
 
                 (b)  any such good when destined for domestic consumption. 
 
 
            Article 605:   Other Export Measures 
 
                 Subject to Annex 605, a Party may adopt or maintain a 
            restriction otherwise justified under Articles XI:2(a) or 
            XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT with respect to the export of an 
            energy or basic petrochemical good to the territory of another 
            Party, only if: 
 
                 (a)  the restriction does not reduce the proportion of the 
                      total export shipments of the specific energy or 
                      basic petrochemical good made available to that other 
                      Party relative to the total supply of that good of 
                      the Party maintaining the restriction as compared to 
                      the proportion prevailing in the most recent 36-month 
                      period for which data are available prior to the 
                      imposition of the measure, or in such other 
                      representative period on which the Parties may agree; 
 
                 (b)  the Party does not impose a higher price for exports 
                      of an energy or basic petrochemical good to that 
                      other Party than the price charged for such good when 
                      consumed domestically, by means of any measure such 
                      as licenses, fees, taxation and minimum price 
                      requirements.  The foregoing provision does not apply 
                      to a higher price that may result from a measure 
                      taken pursuant to subparagraph (a) that only 
                      restricts the volume of exports; and  
 
                 (c)  the restriction does not require the disruption of 
                      normal channels of supply to that other Party or 
                      normal proportions among specific energy or basic 
                      petrochemical goods supplied to that other Party, 
                      such as, for example, between crude oil and refined 
                      products and among different categories of crude oil 
                      and of refined products. 
 
 
            Article 606:   Energy Regulatory Measures 
 
            1.   The Parties recognize that energy regulatory measures are 
            subject to the disciplines of: 
 
                 (a)  national treatment, as provided in Article 301; 
 
                 (b)  import and export restrictions, as provided in 
                      Article 603; and 
 
                 (c)  export taxes, as provided in Article 604. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall seek to ensure that in the application of 
            any energy regulatory measure, energy regulatory bodies within 
            its territory avoid disruption of contractual relationships to 
            the maximum extent practicable, and provide for orderly and 
            equitable implementation appropriate to such measures. 
 
 
            Article 607:   National Security Measures 
 
                 Subject to Annex 607, no Party may adopt or maintain a 
            measure restricting imports of an energy or basic petrochemical 
            good from, or exports of an energy or basic petrochemical good 
            to, another Party under Article XXI of the GATT or under 
            Article 2102 (National Security), except to the extent 
            necessary to: 
 
                 (a)  supply a military establishment of a Party or enable 
                      fulfillment of a critical defense contract of a 
                      Party; 
 
                 (b)  respond to a situation of armed conflict involving 
                      the Party taking the measure; 
 
                 (c)  implement national policies or international 
                      agreements relating to the non-proliferation of

                      facility in Mexico to meet the enterprise's own 
                      supply needs.  Electricity generated in excess of 
                      such needs must be sold to the Federal Electricity 
                      Commission (Comisi n Federal de Electricidad) (CFE) 
                      and CFE shall purchase such electricity under terms 
                      and conditions agreed to by CFE and the enterprise. 
 
                 (b)  Co-generation 
 
                      An enterprise of another Party may acquire, 
                      establish, and/or operate a co-generation facility in 
                      Mexico that generates electricity using heat, steam 
                      or other energy sources associated with an industrial 
                      process.  Owners of the industrial facility need not 
 
                               Annex 602.3                                  

                      be the owners of the co-generating facility.  
                      Electricity generated in excess of the industrial 
                      facility's supply requirements must be sold to CFE 
                      and CFE shall purchase such electricity under terms 
                      and conditions agreed to by CFE and the enterprise. 
 
                 (c)  Independent Power Production

                      facility for independent power production (IPP) in 
                      Mexico.  Electricity generated by such a facility for 
                      sale in Mexico shall be sold to CFE and CFE shall 
                      purchase such electricity under terms and conditions 
                      agreed to by CFE and the enterprise.  Where an IPP 
                      located in Mexico and an electric utility of another 
                      Party consider that cross-border trade in electricity 
                      may be in their interests, each relevant Party shall 
                      permit these entities and CFE to negotiate terms and 
                      conditions of power purchase and power sale 
                      contracts.  The modalities of implementing such 
                      supply contracts are left to the end users, suppliers 
                      and CFE and may take the form of individual contracts 
                      between CFE and each of the other entities.  Each 
                      relevant Party shall determine whether such contracts 
                      are subject to regulatory approval.

                                     Chapter Seven 
 
                  Agriculture and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 
 
 
                                Section A - Agriculture 
 
            Article 701:    Scope and Coverage 
 
            1.   This Section applies to measures adopted or maintained by 
            a Party relating to agricultural trade. 
 
            2.   In the event of any inconsistency between this Section and 
            another provision of this Agreement, this Section shall prevail 
            to the extent of the inconsistency. 
 
 
            Article 702:    International Obligations 
 
            1.   Annex 702.1 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex 
            with respect to agricultural trade under certain agreements 
            between them. 
 
            2.   Prior to adopting pursuant to an intergovernmental 
            commodity agreement, a measure that may affect trade in an 
            agricultural good between the Parties, the Party proposing to 
            adopt the measure shall consult with the other Parties with a 
            view to avoiding nullification or impairment of a concession 
            granted by that Party in its Schedule to Annex 302.2 (Tariff 
            Elimination). 
 
            3.   Annex 702.3 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex 
            with respect to measures adopted or maintained pursuant to an 
            intergovernmental coffee agreement. 
 
 
            Article 703:    Market Access 
 
            1.   The Parties shall work together to improve access to their 
            respective markets through the reduction or elimination of 
            import barriers to trade between them in agricultural goods. 
 
            Customs Duties, Quantitative Restrictions, and Agricultural 
            Grading and Marketing Standards  
 
            2.   Annex 703.2 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex 
            with respect to customs duties and quantitative restrictions, 
            trade in sugar and syrup goods, and agricultural grading and 
            marketing standards. 
 
            Special Safeguard Provisions 
 
            3.   Each Party may, in accordance with its Schedule to Annex 
            302.2, adopt or maintain a special safeguard in the form of a 
            tariff rate quota on an agricultural good listed in its Section 
            of Annex 703.3.  Notwithstanding Article 302.2, a Party may not 
            apply an over-quota tariff rate under a special safeguard that 
            exceeds the lesser of: 
 
                 (a)  the most-favored-nation (MFN) rate as of July 1, 
                      1991; and  
 
                 (b)  the prevailing MFN rate. 
 
            4.   No Party may, with respect to the same good and the same 
            country, at the same time: 
 
                 (a)  apply an over-quota tariff rate under paragraph 3; 
                      and  
 
                 (b)  take an emergency action covered by Chapter Eight 
                      (Emergency Action). 
 
 
            Article 704:    Domestic Support 
 
                 The Parties recognize that domestic support measures can 
            be of crucial importance to their agricultural sectors but may 
            also have trade distorting and production effects and that 
            domestic support reduction commitments may result from 
            agricultural multilateral trade negotiations under the General 
            Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  Accordingly, where a 
            Party supports its agricultural producers, that Party should 
            endeavor to work toward domestic support measures that: 
 
                 (a)  have minimal or no trade distorting or production 
                      effects; or 
 
                 (b)  are exempt from any applicable domestic support 
                      reduction commitments that may be negotiated under 
                      the GATT. 
 
            The Parties further recognize that a Party may change its 
            domestic support measures, including those that may be subject 
            to reduction commitments, at the Party's discretion, subject to 
            its rights and obligations under the GATT. 
 
            Article 705:    Export Subsidies 
 
            1.   The Parties share the objective of the multilateral 
            elimination of export subsidies for agricultural goods and 
            shall cooperate in an effort to achieve an agreement under the 
            GATT to eliminate those subsidies. 
 
            2.   The Parties recognize that export subsidies for 
            agricultural goods may prejudice the interests of importing and 
            exporting Parties and, in particular, may disrupt the markets 
            of importing Parties.  Accordingly, in addition to the rights 
            and obligations of the Parties specified in Annex 702.1, the 
            Parties affirm that it is inappropriate for a Party to provide 
            an export subsidy for an agricultural good exported to the 
            territory of another Party where there are no other subsidized 
            imports of that good into the territory of that other Party. 
 
            3.   Except as provided in Annex 702.1, where an exporting 
            Party considers that a non-Party is exporting an agricultural 
            good to the territory of another Party with the benefit of 
            export subsidies, the importing Party shall, on written request 
            of the exporting Party, consult with the exporting Party with a 
            view to agreeing on specific measures that the importing Party 
            may adopt to counter the effect of any such subsidized imports. 

            If the importing Party adopts the agreed-upon measures, the 
            exporting Party shall refrain from applying, or immediately 
            cease to apply, any export subsidy to exports of such good to 
            the territory of the importing Party. 
 
            4.   Except as provided in Annex 702.1, an exporting Party 
            shall deliver written notice to the importing Party at least 
            three days, excluding weekends, prior to adopting an export 
            subsidy measure on an agricultural good exported to the 
            territory of another Party.  The exporting Party shall consult 
            with the importing Party within 72 hours of receipt of the 
            importing Party's written request, with a view to eliminating 
            the subsidy or minimizing any adverse impact on the market of 
            the importing Party for that good.  The importing Party shall, 
            when requesting consultations with the exporting Party, at the 
            same time, deliver written notice to a third Party of the 
            request.  A third Party may request to participate in such 
            consultations. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall take into account the interests of the 
            other Parties in the use of any export subsidy on an 
            agricultural good, recognizing that such subsidies may have 
            prejudicial effects on the interests of the other Parties. 
 
            6.   The Parties hereby establish a Working Group on 
            Agricultural Subsidies, comprising representatives of each 
            Party, which shall meet at least semi-annually or as the 
            Parties may otherwise agree, to work toward elimination of all 
            export subsidies affecting agricultural trade between the 
            Parties.  The functions of the Working Group shall include: 
 
                 (a)  monitoring the volume and price of imports into the 
                      territory of any Party of agricultural goods that 
                      have benefitted from export subsidies; 
 
                 (b)  providing a forum for the Parties to develop mutually 
                      acceptable criteria and procedures for reaching 
                      agreement on the limitation or elimination of export 
                      subsidies for imports of agricultural goods into the 
                      territories of the Parties; and 
 
                 (c)  reporting annually to the Committee on Agricultural 
                      Trade, established under Article 706, on the 
                      implementation of this Article. 
 
            7.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article: 
 
                 (a)  if the importing and exporting Parties agree to an 
                      export subsidy for an agricultural good exported to 
                      the territory of the importing Party, the exporting 
                      Party or Parties may adopt or maintain such subsidy; 
                      and 
 
                 (b)  each Party retains its rights to apply countervailing 
                      duties to subsidized imports of agricultural goods 
                      from the territory of a Party or non-Party. 
 
 
            Article 706:    Committee on Agricultural Trade 
 
            1.   The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Agricultural 
            Trade, comprising representatives of each Party. 
 
            2.   The Committee's functions shall include: 
 
                 (a)  monitoring and promoting cooperation on the 
                      implementation and administration of this Section; 
 
                 (b)  providing a forum for the Parties to consult on 
                      issues related to this Section at least semi-annually 
                      and as the Parties may otherwise agree; and 
 
                 (c)  reporting annually to the Commission on the 
                      implementation of this Section. 
 
 
            Article 707:    Advisory Committee on Private Commercial 
                            Disputes regarding Agricultural Goods 
 
                 The Committee shall establish an Advisory Committee on 
            Private Commercial Disputes regarding Agricultural Goods, 
            comprising persons with expertise or experience in the 
            resolution of private commercial disputes in agricultural 
            trade.  The Advisory Committee shall report and provide 
            recommendations to the Committee for the development of systems 
            in the territory of each Party to achieve the prompt and 
            effective resolution of such disputes, taking into account any 
            special circumstance, including the perishability of certain 
            agricultural goods.

                           Incorporation of Trade Provisions 
 
 
            1.   Articles 701, 702, 704, 705, 706, 707, 710 and 711 of the 
            Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement apply, as between 
            Canada and the United States, which Articles are hereby 
            incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement. 
 
            2.   The definitions of the terms specified in Article 711 of 
            the Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement shall apply to 
            the Articles incorporated by paragraph 1.

            of this Agreement. 
 
            4.   The Parties understand that Article 710 of the Canada - 
            United States Free Trade Agreement incorporates the GATT rights 
            and obligations of Canada and the United States with respect to 
            agricultural, food, beverage and certain related goods, 
            including exemptions by virtue of paragraph (1)(b) of the

                           Intergovernmental Coffee Agreement 
 
 
                 Notwithstanding Article 2101 (General Exceptions), neither 
            Canada nor Mexico may adopt or maintain a measure, pursuant to 
            an intergovernmental coffee agreement, that restricts trade in 
            coffee between them. 
                          
 
                                      Annex 703.2 
 
                                     Market Access 
 
                        Section A - Mexico and the United States 
 
            1.   This Section applies only as between Mexico and the United 
            States. 
 
            Customs Duties and Quantitative Restrictions 
 
            2.   With respect to agricultural goods, Article 309(1) and (2) 
            (Import and Export Restrictions) applies only to qualifying 
            goods. 
 
            3.   Each Party waives its rights under Article XI:2(c) of the 
            GATT, and those rights as incorporated by Article 309, 
            regarding any measure adopted or maintained with respect to the 
            importation of qualifying goods. 
 
            4.   Except with respect to a good set out in Section B or C of 
            Annex 703.3 or Appendix 703.2.A.4, where a Party applies an 
            over-quota tariff rate to a qualifying good pursuant to a 
            tariff rate quota set out in its Schedule to Annex 302.2, or 
            increases a customs duty for a sugar or syrup good to a rate, 
            in accordance with paragraph 18, that exceeds the rate of 
            customs duty for that good set out in its GATT Schedule of 
            Tariff Concessions as of July 1, 1991, the other Party waives 
            its rights under the GATT with respect to the application of 
            that rate of customs duty. 
 
            5.   Notwithstanding Article 302(2) (Tariff Elimination), where 
            an agreement resulting from agricultural multilateral trade 
            negotiations under the GATT enters into force with respect to a 
            Party pursuant to which it has agreed to convert a prohibition 
            or restriction on its importation of an agricultural good into 
            a tariff rate quota or a customs duty, that Party may not apply 
            to such good that is a qualifying good an over-quota tariff 
            rate that is higher than the lower of the over-quota tariff 
            rate set out in: 
 
                 (a)  its Schedule to Annex 302.2, and 
 
                 (b)  that agreement, 
 
            and paragraph 4 shall no longer apply to the other Party with 
            respect to that good. 
 
                              Annex 703.2                                   
 
            6.   Each Party may count the in-quota quantity under a tariff 
            rate quota applied to a qualifying good in accordance with its 
            Schedule to Annex 302.2 toward the satisfaction of commitments 
            regarding an in-quota quantity of a tariff rate quota or level 
            of access under a restriction on the importation of that good: 
 
                 (a)  that have been agreed under the GATT, including as 
                      set out in its GATT Schedule of Tariff Concessions; 
                      or  
 
                 (b)  undertaken by the Party as a result of any agreement 
                      resulting from agricultural multilateral trade 
                      negotiations under the GATT. 
 
            7.   Neither Party may count toward the satisfaction of a 
            commitment regarding an in-quota quantity of a tariff rate 
            quota in its Schedule to Annex 302.2 an agricultural good 
            admitted or entered into a maquiladora or foreign-trade zone 
            and re-exported, including subsequent to processing. 
 
            8.   The United States shall not adopt or maintain, with 
            respect to the importation of an agricultural qualifying good, 
            any fee applied pursuant to section 22 of the U.S. Agricultural 
            Adjustment Act. 
 
            9.   Neither Party may seek a voluntary restraint agreement 
            from the other Party with respect to the exportation of meat 
            that is a qualifying good. 
 
            10.  Notwithstanding Chapter Four (Rules of Origin), for 
            purposes of applying a rate of customs duty to a good, the 
            United States may consider as if it were non-originating a good 
            provided for in: 
 
                 (a)  heading 12.02 that is exported from the territory of 
                      Mexico, if the good is not wholly obtained in the 
                      territory of Mexico; 
 
                 (b)  subheading 2008.11 that is exported from the 
                      territory of Mexico, if any material provided for in 
                      heading 12.02 used in the production of that good is 
                      not wholly obtained in the territory of Mexico; or 
 
                 (c)  U.S. tariff item 1806.10.42 or 2106.90.12 that is 
                      exported from the territory of Mexico, if any 
                      material provided for in HS heading 1701.99 used in 
                      the production of that good is not a qualifying good. 
 
                                    Annex 703.2                             
 
            11.  Notwithstanding Chapter Four, for purposes of applying a 
            rate of customs duty to a good, Mexico may consider as if it 
            were non-originating a good provided for in: 
 
                 (a)  heading 12.02 that is exported from the territory of 
                      the United States, if that good is not wholly 
                      obtained in the territory of the United States; 
 
                 (b)  subheading 2008.11 that is exported from the 
                      territory of the United States, if any material 
                      provided for in heading 12.02 used in the production 
                      of that good is not wholly obtained in the territory 
                      of the United States; or 
 
                 (c)  Mexican tariff item 1806.10.01 (except those with a 
                      sugar content less than 90 percent) or 2106.90.05 
                      (except those that contain added flavoring matter) 
                      that is exported from the territory of the United 
                      States, if any material provided for in HS subheading 
                      1701.99 used in the production of that good is not a 
                      qualifying good. 
 
            Restriction on Same-Condition Substitution Duty Drawback 
 
            12.  Beginning on the date of entry into force of this 
            Agreement, neither Mexico nor the United States may refund the 
            amount of customs duties paid, or waive or reduce the amount of 
            customs duties owed, on any agricultural good imported into its 
            territory that is substituted for an identical or similar good 
            that is subsequently exported to the territory of the other 
            Party. 
 
            Trade in Sugar and Syrup Goods 
 
            13.  The Parties shall consult by July 1 of each of the first 
            14 years beginning with 1994 to determine jointly, in 
            accordance with Appendix 703.2.A.13, whether, and if so, by 
            what quantity either Party: 
 
                 (a)  is projected to be a net surplus producer of sugar in 
                      the next marketing year; and 
 
                 (b)  has been a net surplus producer in any marketing year 
                      beginning after the date of entry into force of this 
                      Agreement, including the current marketing year. 
 
            14.  For each of the first 14 marketing years beginning after 
            the date of entry into force of this Agreement, each Party 
 
                                    Annex 703.2                             
  
            shall accord duty-free treatment to a quantity of sugar and 
            syrup goods that are qualifying goods not less than the 
            greatest of: 
 
                 (a)   7,258 metric tons raw value;  
 
                 (b)  the quota allocated by the United States for a non- 
                      Party within the category designated "other specified 
                      countries and areas" under paragraph (b)(i) of 
                      additional U.S. note 3 to chapter 17 of the 
                      Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States; and 
 
                 (c)  subject to paragraph 15, the other Party's projected 
                      net production surplus for that marketing year, as 
                      determined under paragraph 13 and adjusted in 
                      accordance with Appendix 703.2.A.13. 
 
            15.  Subject to paragraph 16, the duty-free quantity of sugar 
            and syrup goods under paragraph 14(c) shall not exceed the 
            following ceilings: 
              
                 (a)  for each of the first six marketing years, 25,000 
                      metric tons raw value; 
 
                 (b)  for the seventh marketing year, 150,000 metric tons 
                      raw value; and 
 
                 (c)  for each of the eighth through 14th marketing years, 
                      110 percent of the previous marketing year's ceiling. 
 
            16.  Beginning with the seventh marketing year, paragraph 15 
            shall not apply where, pursuant to paragraph 13, the Parties 
            have determined the exporting Party to be a net surplus 
            producer: 
 
                 (a)  for any two consecutive marketing years beginning 
                      after the date of entry into force of this Agreement; 
 
                 (b)  for the previous and current marketing years; or 
 
                 (c)  in the current marketing year and projected it to be 
                      a net surplus producer in the next marketing year, 
                      unless subsequently the Parties determine that, 
                      contrary to the projection, the exporting Party was 
                      not a net surplus producer for that year. 
 
            17.  Mexico shall, beginning no later than six years after the 
            date of entry into force of this Agreement, apply on a most- 
 
                                   Annex 703.2                              
 
            favored-nation (MFN) basis a tariff rate quota for sugar and 
            syrup goods consisting of rates of customs duties no less than 
            the lesser of the corresponding: 
 
                 (a)  MFN rates of the United States in effect on the date 
                      that Mexico commences to apply the tariff rate quota; 
                      and 
 
                 (b)  prevailing MFN rates of the United States. 
 
            18.  When Mexico applies a tariff rate quota under paragraph 
            17, it shall not apply on a sugar or syrup good that is a 
            qualifying good a rate of customs duty higher than the rate of 
            customs duty applied by the United States on such good. 
 
            19.   Each Party shall determine the quantity of a sugar or 
            syrup good that is a qualifying good based on the actual weight 
            of such good, converted as appropriate to raw value, without 
            regard to the good's packaging or presentation. 
 
            20.  If the United States eliminates its tariff rate quota for 
            sugar and syrup goods imported from non-Parties, at such time 
            the United States shall accord to such goods that are 
            qualifying goods the better of the treatment, as determined by 
            Mexico, of: 
 
                 (a)  the treatment provided for in paragraphs 14 through 
                      16; or 
 
                 (b)  the MFN treatment granted by the United States to 
                      non-Parties. 
 
            21.   Except as provided in paragraph 22, Mexico shall not be 
            required to apply the applicable rate of customs duty provided 
            in this Annex or in its Schedule to Annex 302.2 to a sugar or 
            syrup good, or sugar-containing product, that is a qualifying 
            good where the United States has granted or will grant benefits 
            under any re-export program or any like program in connection 
            with the export of the good.  The United States shall notify 
            Mexico in writing within two days, excluding weekends, of any 
            export to Mexico of such a good for which the benefits of any 
            re-export program or any other like program have been or will 
            be claimed by the exporter. 
 
            22.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section: 
 
                 (a)  the United States shall accord duty-free treatment to 
                      imports of 
 
                                  Annex 703.2                               
 
                      (i)   raw sugar that is a qualifying good that will 
                            be refined in the territory of the United 
                            States and re-exported to the territory of 
                            Mexico, and 
 
                      (ii)  refined sugar that is a qualifying good that 
                            has been refined from raw sugar produced in, 
                            and exported from, the territory of the United 
                            States; 
 
                 (b)  Mexico shall accord duty-free treatment to imports of 
 
                      (i)   raw sugar that is a qualifying good that will 
                            be refined in the territory of Mexico and re- 
                            exported to the territory of the United 
                            States, and 
 
                      (ii)  refined sugar that is a qualifying good that 
                            has been refined from raw sugar produced in, 
                            and exported from, the territory of Mexico; 
                            and 
 
                 (c)  imports qualifying for duty-free treatment pursuant 
                      to subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall not be subject to, 
                      or counted under, any tariff rate quota. 
 
            Agricultural Grading and Marketing Standards 
 
            23.  Where a Party adopts or maintains a measure respecting the 
            classification, grading or marketing of a domestic agricultural 
            good, it shall accord treatment to a like qualifying good 
            destined for processing no less favorable than it accords under 
            the measure to the domestic good destined for processing. The 
            importing Party may adopt or maintain measures to ensure that 
            such imported good is processed. 
 
            24.  Paragraph 23 shall be without prejudice to the rights of 
            either Party under the GATT or under Chapter Three (National 
            Treatment and Market Access) regarding measures respecting the 
            classification, grading or marketing of an agricultural good, 
            whether or not destined for processing. 
 
            25.  The Parties hereby establish a Working Group, comprising 
            representatives of Mexico and the United States, which shall 
            meet annually or as otherwise agreed.  The Working Group shall 
            review, in coordination with the Committee on Standards-Related 
            Measures established under Article 913 (Committee on Standards- 
            Related Measures), the operation of agricultural grade and

            quality standards as they affect trade between the Parties, and 
            shall resolve issues that may arise regarding the operation of 
            the standards.  This Working Group shall report to the 
            Committee on Agricultural Trade established under Article 706.

            further processing or refining; 
 
            qualifying good means an originating good that is an 
            agricultural good, except that in determining whether such good 
            is an originating good, operations performed in or materials 
            obtained from Canada shall be considered as if they were 
            performed in or obtained from a non-Party; 
 
            raw value means the equivalent of a quantity of sugar in terms 
            of raw sugar testing 96 degrees by the polariscope, determined 
            as follows: 
 
                 (a)  the raw value of plantation white sugar equals the 
                      number of kilograms thereof multiplied by 1.03;

            (Import and Export Restrictions) applies only to qualifying 
            goods. 
 
            3.   Except with respect to a good set out in Sections A or B 
            of Annex 703.3., where a Party applies an over-quota tariff 
            rate to a qualifying good pursuant to a tariff rate quota set 
            out in its Schedule to Annex 302.2 or increases a customs duty 
            for a sugar or syrup good to a rate that exceeds the rate of 
            customs duty for that good set out in its GATT Schedule of 
            Tariff Concessions as of July 1, 1991, the other Party waives 
            its rights under the GATT with respect to the application of 
            that rate of customs duty. 
 
            4.   Notwithstanding Article 302(2) (Tariff Elimination), where 
            an agreement resulting from agricultural multilateral trade 
            negotiations under the GATT enters into force with respect to a 
            Party pursuant to which it has agreed to convert a prohibition 
            or restriction on its importation of an agricultural good into 
            a tariff rate quota or a customs duty, that Party may not apply 
            to such good that is a qualifying good an over-quota tariff 
            rate that is higher than the lower of the over-quota tariff 
            rate in: 
 
                 (a)  its Schedule to Annex 302.2, and 
 
                 (b)  that agreement, 
 
            and paragraph 3 shall no longer apply to the other Party with 
            respect to that good.  
 
                                  Annex 703.2                               
 
            5.   Each Party may count the in-quota quantity under a tariff 
            rate quota applied to a qualifying good in accordance with its 
            Schedule to Annex 302.2 toward the satisfaction of commitments 
            regarding an in-quota quantity of a tariff rate quota or level 
            of access under a restriction on the importation of that good: 
 
                 (a)  that have been agreed under the GATT, including as 
                      set out in its GATT Schedule of Tariff Concessions; 
                      or  
 
                 (b)  undertaken by the Party as a result of any agreement 
                      resulting from agricultural multilateral trade

            Canada and Mexico incorporate their respective rights and 
            obligations with respect to agricultural goods under the GATT 
            and agreements negotiated under the GATT, including their 
            rights and obligations under Article XI of the GATT. 
 
            7.   Notwithstanding paragraph 6 and Article 309:

                      Article XI:2(c)(i) of the GATT and those rights as 
                      incorporated by Article 309 shall apply with respect 
                      to trade in agricultural goods only to the dairy, 
                      poultry and egg goods set out in Appendix 703.2.B.7; 
                      and  
 
                 (b)  with respect to such dairy, poultry and egg goods 
                      that are qualifying goods, either Party may adopt or 
                      maintain a prohibition or restriction or a customs 
                      duty on the importation of such good consistent with 
                      its rights and obligations under the GATT. 
 
            8.   Without prejudice to Chapter Eight (Emergency Action), 
            neither Party may seek a voluntary restraint agreement from the 
            other Party with respect to the exportation of a qualifying 
            good. 
 
            9.   Notwithstanding Chapter Four (Rules of Origin), Mexico may 
            treat a good provided for in Mexican tariff item 1806.10.01 
            (except those with a sugar content less than 90 percent) or 
            2106.90.05 (except those that contain added flavoring matter) 
            that is exported from the territory of Canada as non- 
            originating for purposes of applying a rate of customs duty to 
            that good, if any material provided for in HS subheading

            1701.99 used in the production of such good is not a qualifying 
            good. 
 
            10.  Notwithstanding Chapter Four (Rules of Origin), Canada may 
            treat a good provided for in Canadian tariff item 1806.10.10 or 
            2106.90.21 that is exported from the territory of Mexico as 
            non-originating for purposes of applying a rate of customs duty 
            to that good, if any material provided for in HS subheading 
            1701.99 used in the production of such good is not a qualifying 
            good. 
 
            Trade in Sugar 
 
            11.  Mexico shall apply a rate of customs duty equal to its 
            most-favored-nation over-quota tariff rate to a sugar or syrup 
            that is a qualifying good. 
 
            12.  Canada may apply a rate of customs duty on a sugar or 
            syrup good that is a qualifying good equal to the rate of 
            customs duty applied by Mexico pursuant to paragraph 11. 
 
            Agricultural Grading and Marketing Standards 
 
            13.  The Parties hereby establish a Working Group, comprising 
            representatives of Canada and Mexico, which shall meet annually 
            or as otherwise agreed.  The Working Group shall review, in 
            coordination with the Committee on Standards-Related Measures 
            established under Article 913 (Committee on Standards-Related 
            Measures), the operation of agricultural grade and quality 
            standards as they affect trade between the Parties, and shall 
            resolve issues that may arise regarding the operation of the 
            standards.  This Working Group shall report to the Committee on 
            Agricultural Trade established under Article 706.

            14.  For purposes of this Section: 
 
            qualifying good means an originating good that is an 
            agricultural good except that, in determining whether such good 
            is an originating good, operations performed in or material 
            obtained from the United States shall be considered as if they 
            were performed in or obtained from a non-Party.

                 Determination and Adjustment of Net Production Surplus 
 
            1.   For purposes of Section A(14)(c), where the Parties 
            project a net production surplus for a Party for the next 
            marketing year, the projected surplus shall be: 
 
                 (a)  increased by the amount, if any, by which the actual 
                      net production surplus exceeds the projected net 
                      production surplus in the most recent marketing year 
                      for which the Parties projected a net production 
                      surplus for that Party; or 
 
                 (b)  decreased by the amount, if any, by which the 
                      projected net production surplus exceeds the actual 
                      net production surplus in the most recent marketing 
                      year for which the Parties projected a net production 
                      surplus for that Party; 
 
            as further demonstrated by the following formulas: 
 
                                ANPS = (PPy - CPy) + CF 
 
                 where:     ANPS  =  adjusted net production surplus 
                            PP  =    projected domestic production of sugar 
                            CP  =    projected total consumption of sugar 
                            CF  =    correction factor 
                            y   =    next marketing year, 
 
            and 
 
                           CF = (PAys - CAys) - (PPys - CPys) 
 
                 where:     PA  =    actual domestic production of sugar

                            CA  =    actual total consumption of sugar 
                            ys  =    most recent previous marketing year 
                                     for which the Parties projected a net 
                                     production surplus for that Party. 
 
            2.   For purposes only of paragraph 1, neither the projected

                   Section B - Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 
 
          Article 709:    Scope and Coverage 
 
               In order to establish a framework of rules and disciplines 
          to guide the development, adoption and enforcement of sanitary 
          and phytosanitary measures, this Section applies to any such 
          measure of a Party that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade 
          between the Parties. 
 
 
          Article 710:    Relation to Other Chapters 
 
               Articles 301 (National Treatment) and 309 (Import and Export 
          Restrictions), and the provisions of Article XX(b) of the GATT as 
          incorporated into Article 2101(1) (General Exceptions), do not 
          apply to any sanitary or phytosanitary measure. 
 
 
          Article 711:    Reliance on Non-Governmental Entities 
 
               Each Party shall ensure that any non-governmental entity on 
          which it relies in applying a sanitary or phytosanitary measure 
          acts in a manner consistent with this Section. 
 
 
          Article 712:    Basic Rights and Obligations 
 
          Right to Take Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 
 
          1.   Each Party may, in accordance with this Section, adopt, 
          maintain or apply any sanitary or phytosanitary measure necessary 
          for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health in 
          its territory, including a measure more stringent than an 
          international standard, guideline or recommendation. 
 
          Right to Establish Level of Protection 
 
          2.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, each 
          Party may, in protecting human, animal or plant life or health, 
          establish its appropriate levels of protection in accordance with 
          Article 715. 
 
          Scientific Principles 
 
          3.   Each Party shall ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary 
          measure that it adopts, maintains or applies is: 
 
               (a)  based on scientific principles, taking into account 
                    relevant factors including, where appropriate, 
                    different geographic conditions; 
 
               (b)  not maintained where there is no longer a scientific 
                    basis for it; and 
 
               (c)  based on a risk assessment, as appropriate to the 
                    circumstances. 
 
          Non-Discriminatory Treatment 
 
          4.   Each Party shall ensure that a sanitary or phytosanitary 
          measure that it adopts, maintains or applies does not arbitrarily 
          or unjustifiably discriminate between its goods and like goods of 
          another Party, or between goods of another Party and like goods 
          of any other country, where identical or similar conditions 
          prevail. 
 
          Unnecessary Obstacles 
 
          5.   Each Party shall ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary 
          measure that it adopts, maintains or applies is applied only to 
          the extent necessary to achieve its appropriate level of 
          protection, taking into account technical and economic 
          feasibility. 
 
          Disguised Restrictions 
 
          6.    No Party may adopt, maintain or apply any sanitary or 
          phytosanitary measure with a view to, or with the effect of, 
          creating a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties. 
 
 
          Article 713:    International Standards and Standardizing 
                          Organizations 
 
          1.   Without reducing the level of protection of human, animal or 
          plant life or health, each Party shall use, as a basis for its 
          sanitary and phytosanitary measures, relevant international 
          standards, guidelines or recommendations with the objective, 
          among others, of making its sanitary and phytosanitary measures 
          equivalent or, where appropriate, identical to those of the other 
          Parties. 
 
          2.   A Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure that conforms to 
          a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation 
          shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 712. A measure 
          that results in a level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection 
          different from that which would be achieved by a measure based on 
          a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation 
          shall not for that reason alone be presumed to be inconsistent 
          with this Section. 
 
          3.   Nothing in Paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party 
          from adopting, maintaining or applying, in accordance with the 
          other provisions of this Section, a sanitary or phytosanitary 
          measure that is more stringent than the relevant international 
          standard, guideline or recommendation. 
 
          4.   Where a Party has reason to believe that a sanitary or 
          phytosanitary measure of another Party is adversely affecting or 
          may adversely affect its exports and the measure is not based on 
          a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation, 
          it may request, and the other Party shall provide in writing, the 
          reasons for the measure. 
 
          5.   Each Party shall, to the greatest extent practicable, 
          participate in relevant international and North American 
          standardizing organizations, including the Codex Alimentarius  
          Commission, the International Office of Epizootics, the 
          International Plant Protection Convention, and the North American 
          Plant Protection Organization, with a view to promoting the 
          development and periodic review of international standards, 
          guidelines and recommendations. 
 
 
          Article 714:    Equivalence 
 
          1.   Without reducing the level of protection of human, animal or 
          plant life or health, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent 
          practicable and in accordance with this Section, pursue 
          equivalence of their respective sanitary and phytosanitary 
          measures. 
 
          2.   Each importing Party: 
 
               (a)  shall treat a sanitary or phytosanitary measure adopted 
                    or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to 
                    its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with 
                    the importing Party, provides to the importing Party 
                    scientific evidence or other information, in accordance 
                    with risk assessment methodologies agreed on by those 
                    Parties, to demonstrate objectively, subject to 
                    subparagraph (b), that the exporting Party's measure 
                    achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of 
                    protection; 
 
               (b)  may, where it has a scientific basis, determine that 
                    the exporting Party's measure does not achieve the 
                    importing Party's appropriate level of protection; and 
            
               (c)  shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its 
                    reasons in writing for a determination under 
                    subparagraph (b). 
 
          3.   For purposes of establishing equivalence, each exporting 
          Party shall, on the request of an importing Party, take such 
          reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate 
          access in its territory for inspection, testing and other 
          relevant procedures. 
 
          4.   Each Party should, in the development of a sanitary or 
          phytosanitary measure, consider relevant actual or proposed 
          sanitary or phytosanitary measures of the other Parties. 
 
 
          Article 715:    Risk Assessment and Appropriate Level of 
                          Protection 
 
          1.   In conducting a risk assessment, each Party shall take into 
          account: 
 
               (a)  relevant risk assessment techniques and methodologies 
                    developed by international or North American 
                    standardizing organizations; 
 
               (b)  relevant scientific evidence; 
 
               (c)  relevant processes and production methods; 
 
               (d)  relevant inspection, sampling and testing methods; 
 
               (e)  the prevalence of relevant diseases or pests, including 
                    the existence of pest-free or disease-free areas or 
                    areas of low pest or disease prevalence; 
 
               (f)  relevant ecological and other environmental conditions; 
                    and 
 
               (g)  relevant treatments, such as quarantines. 
 
          2.   Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall, in establishing 
          its appropriate level of protection regarding the risk associated 
          with the introduction, establishment or spread of an animal or 
          plant pest or disease, and in assessing the risk, also take into 
          account the following economic factors, where relevant: 
 
               (a)  loss of production or sales that may result from the 
                    pest or disease; 
 
               (b)  costs of control or eradication of the pest or disease 
                    in its territory; and 
 
               (c)  the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative 
                    approaches to limiting risks. 
 
 
          3.   Each Party, in establishing its appropriate level of 
          protection: 
 
               (a)  should take into account the objective of minimizing 
                    negative trade effects; and 
 
               (b)  shall, with the objective of achieving consistency in 
                    such levels, avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable 
                    distinctions in such levels in different circumstances, 
                    where such distinctions result in arbitrary or 
                    unjustifiable discrimination against a good of another 
                    Party or constitute a disguised restriction on trade 
                    between the Parties. 
 
          4.   Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (3) and Article 
          712(3)(c), where a Party conducting a risk assessment determines 
          that available relevant scientific evidence or other information 
          is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a 
          provisional sanitary or phytosanitary measure on the basis of 
          available relevant information, including from international or 
          North American standardizing organizations and from sanitary or 
          phytosanitary measures of other Parties.  The Party shall, within 
          a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the 
          assessment is presented to it, complete its assessment, review 
          and, where appropriate, revise the provisional measure in the 
          light of the assessment. 
 
          5.   Where a Party is able to achieve its appropriate level of 
          protection through the phased application of a sanitary or 
          phytosanitary measure, it may, on the request of another Party 
          and in accordance with this Section, allow for such a phased 
          application, or grant specified exceptions for limited periods 
          from the measure, taking into account the requesting Party's 
          export interests. 
 
 
          Article 716:    Adaptation to Regional Conditions 
 
          1.   Each Party shall adapt any of its sanitary or phytosanitary 
          measures relating to the introduction, establishment or spread of 
          an animal or plant pest or disease, to the sanitary or 
          phytosanitary characteristics of the area where a good subject to 
          such a measure is produced and the area in its territory to which 
          the good is destined, taking into account any relevant 
          conditions, including those relating to transportation and 
          handling, between those areas.  In assessing such characteristics 
          of an area, including whether an area is, and is likely to 
          remain, a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest 
          or disease prevalence, each Party shall take into account, among 
          other factors: 
 
               (a)  the prevalence of relevant pests or diseases in that 
                    area; 
 
               (b)  the existence of eradication or control programs in 
                    that area; and 
 
               (c)  any relevant international standard, guideline or 
                    recommendation. 
 
          2.   Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall, in determining 
          whether an area is a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of 
          low pest or disease prevalence, base its determination on factors 
          such as geography, ecosystems, epidemiological surveillance and 
          the effectiveness of sanitary or phytosanitary controls in that 
          area. 
 
          3.   Each importing Party shall recognize that an area in the 
          territory of the exporting Party is, and is likely to remain, a 
          pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest or disease 
          prevalence, where the exporting Party provides to the importing 
          Party scientific evidence or other information sufficient to so 
          demonstrate to the satisfaction of the importing Party.  For this 
          purpose, each exporting Party shall provide reasonable access in 
          its territory to the importing Party for inspection, testing and 
          other relevant procedures. 
 
          4.   Each Party may, in accordance with this Section: 
 
               (a)  adopt, maintain or apply a different risk assessment 
                    procedure for a pest-free or disease-free area than for 
                    an area of low pest or disease prevalence, or 
 
               (b)  make a different final determination for the 
                    disposition of a good produced in a pest-free or 
                    disease-free area than for a good produced in an area 
                    of low pest or disease prevalence, 
 
          taking into account any relevant conditions, including those 
          relating to transportation and handling. 
 
          5.   Each Party shall, in adopting, maintaining or applying a 
          sanitary or phytosanitary measure relating to the introduction, 
          establishment or spread of an animal or plant pest or disease, 
          accord a good produced in a pest-free or disease-free area in the 
          territory of another Party no less favorable treatment than it 
          accords a good produced in a pest-free or disease-free area, in 
          another country, that poses the same level of risk.  The Party 
          shall use equivalent risk assessment techniques to evaluate 
          relevant conditions and controls in the pest-free or disease-free 
          area and in the area surrounding that area and take into account 
          any relevant conditions, including those relating to 
          transportation and handling. 
 
          6.   Each importing Party shall pursue an agreement with an 
          exporting Party, on request, on specific requirements the 
          fulfillment of which allows a good produced in an area of low 
          pest or disease prevalence in the territory of an exporting Party 
          to be imported into the territory of the importing Party and 
          achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of protection. 
 
 
          Article 717:    Control, Inspection and Approval Procedures 
 
          1.   Each Party, with respect to any control or inspection 
          procedure that it conducts: 
 
               (a)  shall initiate and complete the procedure as 
                    expeditiously as possible and in no less favorable 
                    manner for a good of another Party than for a like good 
                    of the Party or of any other country; 
 
               (b)  shall publish the normal processing period for the 
                    procedure or communicate the anticipated processing 
                    period to the applicant on request; 
 
               (c)  shall ensure that the competent body 
 
                    (i)   on receipt of an application, promptly examines 
                          the completeness of the documentation and 
                          informs the applicant in a precise and complete 
                          manner of any deficiency,  
 
                    (ii)  transmits to the applicant as soon as possible 
                          the results of the procedure in a form that is 
                          precise and complete so that the applicant may 
                          take any necessary corrective action, 
 
                    (iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as 
                          far as practicable with the procedure if the 
                          applicant so requests, and  
 
                    (iv)  informs the applicant, on request, of the status 
                          of the application and the reasons for any 
                          delay; 
 
               (d)  shall limit the information the applicant is required 
                    to supply to that necessary for conducting the 
                    procedure; 
 
               (e)  shall accord confidential or proprietary information 
                    arising from, or supplied in connection with, the 
                    procedure conducted for a good of another Party 
 
                    (i)   treatment no less favorable than for a good of 
                          the Party, and  
 
                    (ii)  in any event, treatment that protects the 
                          applicant's legitimate commercial interests, to 
                          the extent provided under the Party's law; 
 
               (f)  shall limit any requirement regarding individual 
                    specimens or samples of a good to that which is 
                    reasonable and necessary; 
 
               (g)  should not impose a fee for conducting the procedure 
                    that is higher for a good of another Party than is 
                    equitable in relation to any such fee it imposes for 
                    its like goods or for like goods of any other country, 
                    taking into account communication, transportation and 
                    other related costs; 
 
               (h)  should use criteria for selecting the location of 
                    facilities at which the procedure is conducted that do 
                    not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or 
                    its agent; 
 
               (i)  shall provide a mechanism to review complaints 
                    concerning the operation of the procedure and to take 
                    corrective action when a complaint is justified; 
 
               (j)  should use criteria for selecting samples of goods that 
                    do not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant 
                    or its agent; and 
 
               (k)  shall limit the procedure, for a good modified 
                    subsequent to a determination that the good fulfills 
                    the requirements of the applicable sanitary or 
                    phytosanitary measure, to that necessary to determine 
                    that the good continues to fulfill the requirements of 
                    that measure. 
 
          2.   Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be 
          necessary, paragraphs 1(a) through (i) to its approval 
          procedures. 
 
          3.   Where an importing Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure 
          requires the conduct of a control or inspection procedure at the 
          level of production, an exporting Party shall, on the request of 
          the importing Party, take such reasonable measures as may be 
          available to it to facilitate access in its territory and to 
          provide assistance necessary to facilitate the conduct of the 
          importing Party's control or inspection procedure. 
 
          4.   A Party maintaining an approval procedure may require its 
          approval for the use of an additive, or its establishment of a 
          tolerance for a contaminant, in a food, beverage or feedstuff, 
          under that procedure prior to granting access to its domestic 
          market for a food, beverage or feedstuff containing that additive 
          or contaminant.  Where such Party so requires, it shall consider 
          using a relevant international standard, guideline or 
          recommendation as the basis for granting access until it 
          completes the procedure. 
 
 
          Article 718:    Notification, Publication and Provision of 
                          Information 
 
          1.   Further to Articles 1802 (Publication) and 1803 
          (Notification and Provision of Information), each Party proposing 
          to adopt or modify a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of general 
          application at the federal level shall: 
 
               (a)  at least 60 days prior to the adoption or modification 
                    of the measure, other than a law, publish a notice and 
                    notify in writing the other Parties of the proposed 
                    measure and provide to the other Parties and publish 
                    the full text of the proposed measure, in such a manner 
                    as to enable interested persons to become acquainted 
                    with the proposed measure; 
 
               (b)  identify in the notice and notification the good to 
                    which the measure would apply, and provide a brief 
                    description of the objective and reasons for the 
                    measure; 
 
               (c)  provide a copy of the proposed measure to any Party or 
                    interested person that so requests and, wherever 
                    possible, identify any provision that deviates in 
                    substance from relevant international standards, 
                    guidelines or recommendations; and 
 
               (d)  without discrimination, allow other Parties and 
                    interested persons to make comments in writing and 
                    shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the 
                    comments and the results of the discussions into 
                    account. 
 
          2.   Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to 
          ensure, with respect to a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of a 
          state or provincial government: 
 
               (a)  that, at an early appropriate stage, a notice and 
                    notification of the type referred to in paragraphs 1(a) 
                    and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and 
 
               (b)  observance of paragraphs 1(c) and (d). 
 
          3.   Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent 
          problem relating to sanitary or phytosanitary protection, it may 
          omit any step set out in paragraph 1 or 2, provided that, on 
          adoption of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, it shall: 
 
               (a)  immediately provide to the other Parties a notification 
                    of the type referred to in paragraph 1(b), including a 
                    brief description of the urgent problem; 
 
               (b)  provide a copy of the measure to any Party or 
                    interested person that so requests; and 
 
               (c)  without discrimination, allow other Parties and 
                    interested persons to make comments in writing and 
                    shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the 
                    comments and the results of the discussions into 
                    account. 
 
          4.   Each Party shall, except where necessary to address an 
          urgent problem referred to in paragraph 3, allow a reasonable 
          period between the publication of a sanitary or phytosanitary 
          measure of general application and the date that it becomes 
          effective to allow time for interested persons to adapt to the 
          measure. 
 
          5.   Each Party shall designate a government authority 
          responsible for the implementation at the federal level of the 
          notification provisions of this Article, and shall notify the 
          other Parties thereof.  Where a Party designates two or more 
          government authorities for this purpose, it shall provide to the 
          other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope 
          of responsibility of each such authority. 
 
          6.   Where an importing Party denies entry into its territory of 
          a good of another Party because it does not comply with a 
          sanitary or phytosanitary measure, the importing Party shall 
          provide a written explanation to the exporting Party, on request, 
          that identifies the applicable measure and the reasons that the 
          good is not in compliance. 
 
 
          Article 719:    Inquiry Points 
 
          1.   Each Party shall ensure that there is one inquiry point that 
          is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and 
          interested persons, and to provide relevant documents, regarding: 
 
               (a)  any sanitary or phytosanitary measure of general 
                    application, including any control or inspection 
                    procedure or approval procedure, proposed, adopted or 
                    maintained in its territory at the federal, state or 
                    provincial government level; 
 
               (b)  the Party's risk assessment procedures and factors it 
                    considers in conducting the assessment and in 
                    establishing its appropriate levels of protection; 
 
               (c)  the membership and participation of the Party, or its 
                    relevant federal, state or provincial government 
                    authorities in international and regional sanitary and 
                    phytosanitary organizations and systems, and in 
                    bilateral and multilateral arrangements within the 
                    scope of this Section, and the provisions of those 
                    systems and arrangements; and 
 
               (d)  the location of notices published pursuant to this 
                    Section or where such information can be obtained. 
 
          2.   Each Party shall ensure that where copies of documents are 
          requested by another Party or by interested persons in accordance 
          with this Section, they are supplied at the same price, apart

          assistance, on mutually agreed terms and conditions, to enhance 
          that Party's sanitary and phytosanitary measures and related 
          activities, including research, processing technologies, 
          infrastructure and the establishment of national regulatory 
          bodies.   Such assistance may include credits, donations and 
          grants for the acquisition of technical expertise, training and 
          equipment that will facilitate the Party's adjustment to and 
          compliance with a Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure. 
 
          2.   Each Party shall, on the request of another Party: 
 
               (a)  provide to that Party information on its technical 
                    cooperation programs regarding sanitary or 
                    phytosanitary measures relating to specific areas of 
                    interest; and

                    or prior to the adoption or change in the application 
                    of, any sanitary or phytosanitary measure.

          Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require a Party to: 
 
               (a)  communicate, publish texts or provide particulars or 
                    copies of documents other than in an official language 
                    of the Party; or 
 
               (b)  furnish any information the disclosure of which would 
                    impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the 
                    public interest or would prejudice the legitimate 
                    commercial interests of particular enterprises.

          who have responsibility for sanitary and phytosanitary matters. 
 
          2.   The Committee should facilitate: 
 
               (a)  the enhancement of food safety and improvement of

                    territories of the Parties; 
 
               (b)  activities of the Parties pursuant to Articles 713 and 
                    714; 
 
               (c)  technical cooperation between the Parties, including 
                    cooperation in the development, application and 
                    enforcement of sanitary or phytosanitary measures; and 
 
               (d)  consultations on specific matters relating to sanitary 
                    or phytosanitary measures. 
 
          3.   The Committee: 
 
               (a)  shall, to the extent possible, in carrying out its 
                    functions, seek the assistance of relevant 
                    international and North American standardizing 
                    organizations to obtain available scientific and 
                    technical advice and minimize duplication of effort; 
 
               (b)  may draw on such experts and expert bodies as it 
                    considers appropriate;

               (d)  shall meet on the request of any Party and, unless the 
                    Parties otherwise agree, at least once each year; and 
 
               (e)  may, as it considers appropriate, establish and 
                    determine the scope and mandate of working groups. 
 
 
          Article 723:    Technical Consultations 
 
          1.   A Party may request consultations with another Party on any 
          matter covered by this Section. 
 
          2.   Each Party should use the good offices of relevant 
          international and North American standardizing organizations, 
          including those referred to in Article 713(5), for advice and 
          assistance on sanitary and phytosanitary matters within their 
          respective mandates. 
 
          3.   Where a Party requests consultations regarding the 
          application of this Section to a Party's sanitary or 
          phytosanitary measure, and so notifies the Committee, the 
          Committee may facilitate the consultations, if it does not 
          consider the matter itself, by referring the matter for 
          non-binding technical advice or recommendations to a working 
          group, including an ad hoc working group, or to another forum.    
                         
__ ___ 
 
          4.   The Committee should consider any matter referred to it 
          under paragraph 3 as expeditiously as possible, particularly 
          regarding perishable goods, and promptly forward to the Parties 
          any technical advice or recommendations that it develops or 
          receives concerning the matter.  The Parties involved shall 
          provide a written response to the Committee concerning the 
          technical advice or recommendations within such time as the 
          Committee may request. 
 
          5.   Where the involved Parties have had recourse to 
          consultations facilitated by the Committee under paragraph 3, the 
          consultations shall, on the agreement of the Parties involved, 
          constitute consultations under Article 2006 (Consultations). 
 
          6.   The Parties confirm that a Party asserting that a sanitary 
          or phytosanitary measure of another Party is inconsistent with 
          this Section shall have the burden of establishing the 
          inconsistency.

                                    Emergency Action 
 
 
            Article 801:   Bilateral Actions 
 
            1.   Subject to paragraphs 2 through 4 and Annex 801.1, and 
            during the transition period only, if a good originating in the 
            territory of a Party, as a result of the reduction or 
            elimination of a duty provided for in this Agreement, is being 
            imported into the territory of another Party in such increased 
            quantities, in absolute terms, and under such conditions that 
            the imports of the good from that Party alone constitute a 
            substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to a 
            domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive 
            good, the Party into whose territory the good is being imported 
            may, to the minimum extent necessary to remedy or prevent the 
            injury: 
 
                 (a)  suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty 
                      provided for under this Agreement on the good;  
 
                 (b)  increase the rate of duty on the good to a level not 
                      to exceed the lesser of 
 
                      (i)  the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of 
                           duty in effect at the time the action is taken, 
                           and 
 
                      (ii) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the 
                           day immediately preceding the date of entry into 
                           force of this Agreement; or 
 
                 (c)  in the case of a duty applied to a good on a seasonal 
                      basis, increase the rate of duty to a level not to 
                      exceed the MFN applied rate of duty that was in 
                      effect on the good for the corresponding season 
                      immediately preceding the date of entry into force of 
                      this Agreement. 
 
            2.   The following conditions and limitations shall apply to a 
            proceeding that may result in emergency action under paragraph 
            1: 
 
                 (a)  a Party shall, without delay, deliver to any Party 
                      that may be affected written notice of, and a request 
                      for consultations regarding, the institution of a 
                      proceeding that could result in emergency action 
                      against a good originating in the territory of a 
                      Party; 
 
                 (b)  any such action shall be initiated no later than one 
                      year after the date of institution of the proceeding; 
 
                 (c)  no action may be maintained 
 
                      (i)  for a period exceeding three years, except where 
                           the good against which the action is taken is 
                           provided for in the items in staging category C+ 
                           of the Schedule to Annex 302.2 (Tariff 
                           Elimination) of the Party taking the action and 
                           that Party determines that the affected industry 
                           has undertaken adjustment and requires an 
                           extension of the period of relief, in which case 
                           the period of relief may be extended for one 
                           year provided that the duty applied during the 
                           initial period of relief is substantially 
                           reduced at the beginning of the extension 
                           period, or 
 
                      (ii) beyond the expiration of the transition period, 
                           except with the consent of the Party against 
                           whose good the action is taken; 
 
                 (d)  no action may be taken by a Party against any 
                      particular good originating in the territory of 
                      another Party more than once during the transition 
                      period; and 
 
                 (e)  on the termination of the action, the rate of duty 
                      shall be the rate that, according to the Party's 
                      Schedule to Annex 302.2 for the staged elimination of 
                      the tariff, would have been in effect one year after 
                      the initiation of the action, and beginning  January 
                      1 of the year following the termination of the 
                      action, at the option of the Party that has taken the 
                      action 
 
                      (i)  the rate of duty shall conform to the applicable 
                           rate set out in its  Schedule to Annex 302.2, or 
 
                      (ii) the tariff shall be eliminated in equal annual 
                           stages ending on the date set out in its 
                           Schedule to Annex 302.2 for the elimination of 
                           the tariff.  
 
            3.   A Party may take a bilateral emergency action after the 
            expiration of the transition period to deal with cases of 
            serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry 
            arising from the operation of this Agreement only with the 
            consent of the Party against whose good the action would be 
            taken. 
 
             4.   The Party taking an action under this Article shall 
            provide to the Party against whose good the action is taken 
            mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of 
            concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or 
            equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to 
            result from the action.  If the Parties concerned are unable to 
            agree on compensation, the Party against whose good the action 
            is taken may take tariff action having trade effects 
            substantially equivalent to the action taken under this 
            Article.  The Party taking the tariff action shall apply the 
            action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the 
            substantially equivalent effects. 
 
            5.   This Article does not apply to emergency actions 
            respecting goods covered by Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel 
            Goods). 
 
 
            Article 802:   Global Actions 
 
            1.   Each Party retains its rights and obligations under 
            Article XIX of the GATT or any safeguard agreement pursuant 
            thereto except those regarding compensation or retaliation and 
            exclusion from an action to the extent that such rights or 
            obligations are inconsistent with this Article.  Any Party 
            taking an emergency action under Article XIX or any such 
            agreement shall exclude imports of a good from each other Party 
            from the action unless: 
 
                 (a)  imports from a Party, considered individually, 
                      account for a substantial share of total imports; and 
 
                 (b)  imports from a Party, considered individually, or in 
                      exceptional circumstances imports from Parties 
                      considered collectively, contribute importantly to 
                      the serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by 
                      imports. 
 
            2.   In determining whether: 
 
                 (a)  imports from a Party, considered individually, 
                      account for a substantial share of total imports, 
                      those imports normally shall not be considered to 
                      account for a substantial share of total imports if 
                      that Party is not among the top five suppliers of the 
                      good subject to the proceeding, measured in terms of 
                      import share during the most recent three-year 
                      period; and 
 
                 (b)  imports from a Party or Parties contribute 
                      importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, 
                      the competent investigating authority shall consider 
                      such factors as the change in the import share of 
                      each Party, and the level and change in the level of 
                      imports of each Party.  In this regard, imports from 
                      a Party normally shall not be deemed to contribute 
                      importantly to serious injury, or the threat thereof, 
                      if the growth rate of imports from a Party during the 
                      period in which the injurious surge in imports 
                      occurred is appreciably lower than the growth rate of 
                      total imports from all sources over the same period.  
 
            3.   A Party taking such action, from which a good from another 
            Party or Parties is initially excluded pursuant to paragraph 1, 
            shall have the right subsequently to include that good from the 
            other Party or Parties in the action in the event that the 
            competent investigating authority determines that a surge in 
            imports of such good from the other Party or Parties undermines 
            the effectiveness of the action. 
 
            4.   A Party shall, without delay, deliver written notice to 
            the other Parties of the institution of a proceeding that may 
            result in emergency action under paragraph 1 or 3. 
 
            5.   No Party may impose restrictions on a good in an action 
            under paragraph 1 or 3: 
 
                 (a)  without delivery of prior written notice to the 
                      Commission, and without adequate opportunity for 
                      consultation with the Party or Parties against whose 
                      good the action is proposed to be taken, as far in 
                      advance of taking the action as practicable; and 
 
                 (b)  that would have the effect of reducing imports of 
                      such good from a Party below the trend of imports of 
                      the good from that Party over a recent representative 
                      base period with allowance for reasonable growth. 
 
            6.   The Party taking an action pursuant to this Article shall 
            provide to the Party or Parties against whose good the action 
            is taken mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the 
            form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade 
            effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties 
            expected to result from the action.  If the Parties concerned 
            are unable to agree on compensation, the Party against whose 
            good the action is taken may take action having trade effects 
            substantially equivalent to the action taken under paragraph 1 
            or 3. 
 
            Article 803:   Administration of Emergency Action Proceedings 
 
            1.   Each Party shall ensure the consistent, impartial and 
            reasonable administration of its laws, regulations, decisions 
            and rulings governing all emergency action proceedings. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall entrust determinations of serious injury, 
            or threat thereof, in emergency action proceedings to a 
            competent investigating authority, subject to review by 
            judicial or administrative tribunals, to the extent provided by 
            domestic law.  Negative injury determinations shall not be 
            subject to modification, except by such review.  The competent 
            investigating authority empowered under domestic law to conduct 
            such proceedings should be provided with the necessary 
            resources to enable it to fulfill its duties. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall adopt or maintain equitable, timely, 
            transparent and effective procedures for emergency action 
            proceedings, in accordance with the requirements set out in 
            Annex 803.3. 
 
            4.   This Article does not apply to emergency actions taken 
            under Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods). 
 
 
            Article 804:   Dispute Settlement in Emergency Action Matters 
 
                 No Party may request the establishment of an arbitral 
            panel under Article 2008 (Request for an Arbitral Panel) 
            regarding any proposed emergency action.

            the Schedule to Annex 302.2 of the Party taking the action, in 
            which case the transition period shall be the period of staged 
            tariff elimination for that good. 
  
 
                                      Annex 801.1 
 
                                   Bilateral Actions

            one Party" means "good originating in the territory of a Party" 
            as defined in Article 805. 
 
                                  Annex 803.3

            Institution of a Proceeding

            1.   An emergency action proceeding may be instituted by a 
            petition or complaint by entities specified in domestic law.  
            The entity filing the petition or complaint shall demonstrate 
            that it is representative of the domestic industry producing a 
            good like or directly competitive with the imported good.  
 
            2.   A Party may institute a proceeding on its own motion or 
            request the competent investigating authority to conduct a 
            proceeding. 
 
            Contents of a Petition or Complaint             
 
            3.   Where the basis for an investigation is a petition or 
            complaint filed by an entity representative of a domestic 
            industry, the petitioning entity shall, in its petition or 
            complaint, provide the following information to the extent that 
            such information is publicly available from governmental or 
            other sources, or best estimates and the basis therefor if such 
            information is not available:

                      imported good concerned, the tariff subheading under 
                      which that good is classified, its current tariff 
                      treatment and the name and description of the like or 
                      directly competitive domestic good concerned;  
 
                 (b)  representativeness - 
 
                      (i)  the names and addresses of the entities filing 
                           the petition or complaint, and the locations of 
                           the establishments in which they produce the 
                           domestic good,  
 
                      (ii) the percentage of domestic production of the 
                           like or directly competitive good that such 
                           entities account for and the basis for claiming 
                           that they are representative of an industry, and 
 
                      (iii)     the names and locations of all other 
                                domestic establishments in which the like

                 (c)  import data - import data for each of the five most 
                      recent full years that form the basis of the claim 
                      that the good concerned is being imported in 
                      increased quantities, either in absolute terms or 
                      relative to domestic production as appropriate; 
 
                 (d)  domestic production data - data on total domestic

                      the level of sales, prices, production, productivity, 
                      capacity utilization, market share, profits and 
                      losses, and employment; 
 
                 (f)  cause of injury - an enumeration and description of 
                      the alleged causes of the injury, or threat thereof, 
                      and a summary of the basis for the assertion that 
                      increased imports, either actual or relative to 
                      domestic production, of the imported good are causing 
                      or threatening to cause serious injury, supported by 
                      pertinent data; and

                      the petitioner's views on the extent to which such 
                      imports are contributing importantly to the serious 
                      injury, or threat thereof, caused by imports of that 
                      good. 
              
            4.   Petitions or complaints, except to the extent that they 
            contain confidential business information, shall promptly be 
            made available for public inspection on being filed. 
 
            Notice Requirement   
 
            5.   On instituting an emergency action proceeding, the 
            competent investigating authority shall publish notice of the 
            institution of the proceeding in the official journal of the 
            Party.  The notice shall identify the petitioner or other 
            requester, the imported good that is the subject of the 
            proceeding and its tariff subheading, the nature and timing of 
            the determination to be made, the time and place of the public 
            hearing, dates of deadlines for filing briefs, statements and 
            other documents, the place at which the petition and any other 
 
                                  Annex 803.3                               
 
            documents filed in the course of the proceeding may be 
            inspected, and the name, address and telephone number of the 
            office to be contacted for more information.  
 
            6.   With respect to an emergency action proceeding instituted 
            on the basis of a petition or complaint filed by an entity 
            asserting that it is representative of the domestic industry, 
            the competent investigating authority shall not publish the 
            notice required by paragraph 5 without first assessing 
            carefully that the petition or complaint meets the requirements 
            of paragraph 3, including representativeness. 
 
            Public Hearing 
 
            7.   In the course of each proceeding, the competent 
            investigating authority shall: 
 
                 (a)  hold a public hearing, after providing reasonable 
                      notice, to allow all interested parties, and any 
                      association whose purpose is to represent the 
                      interests of consumers in the territory of the Party 
                      instituting the proceeding, to appear in person or by 
                      counsel, to present evidence and to be heard on the 
                      questions of serious injury, or threat thereof, and 
                      the appropriate remedy; and 
 
                 (b)  provide an opportunity to all interested parties and 
                      any such association appearing at the hearing to 
                      cross-question interested parties making 
                      presentations at that hearing. 
 
            Confidential Information 
 
            8.   The competent investigating authority shall adopt or 
            maintain procedures for the treatment of confidential 
            information, protected under domestic law, that is provided in 
            the course of a proceeding, including a requirement that 
            interested parties and consumer associations providing such 
            information furnish non-confidential written summaries thereof, 
            or where they indicate that the information cannot be 
            summarized, the reasons why a summary cannot be provided. 
 
            Evidence of Injury and Causation             
 
            9.   In conducting its proceeding the competent investigating 
            authority shall gather, to the best of its ability, all 
            relevant information appropriate to the determination it must 
            make.  It shall evaluate all relevant factors of an objective 
 
                                     Annex 803.3                            
 
            and quantifiable nature having a bearing on the situation of 
            that industry, including the rate and amount of the increase in 
            imports of the good concerned, in absolute and relative terms 
            as appropriate, the share of the domestic market taken by 
            increased imports, and changes in the level of sales, 
            production, productivity, capacity utilization, profits and 
            losses, and employment.  In making its determination, the 
            competent investigating authority may also consider other 
            economic factors, such as changes in prices and inventories, 
            and the ability of firms in the industry to generate capital. 
 
            10.  The competent investigating authority shall not make an 
            affirmative injury determination unless its investigation 
            demonstrates, on the basis of objective evidence, the existence 
            of a clear causal link between increased imports of the good 
            concerned and serious injury, or threat thereof.  Where factors 
            other than increased imports are causing injury to the domestic 
            industry at the same time, such injury shall not be attributed 
            to increased imports. 
 
            Deliberation and Report 
 
            11.  Except in critical circumstances and in global actions 
            involving perishable agricultural goods, the competent 
            investigating authority, before making an affirmative 
            determination in an emergency action proceeding, shall allow 
            sufficient time to gather and consider the relevant 
            information, hold a public hearing and provide an opportunity 
            for all interested parties and consumer associations to prepare 
            and submit their views. 
 
            12.  The competent investigating authority shall publish 
            promptly a report, including a summary thereof in the official 
            journal of the Party, setting out its findings and reasoned 
            conclusions on all pertinent issues of law and fact.  The 
            report shall describe the imported good and its tariff item 
            number, the standard applied and the finding made.  The 
            statement of reasons shall set out the basis for the 
            determination, including a description of:   
 
                 (a)  the domestic industry seriously injured or threatened 
                      with serious injury; 
 
                 (b)  information supporting a finding that imports are 
                      increasing, the domestic industry is seriously 
                      injured or threatened with serious injury, and 
                      increasing imports are causing or threatening serious 
                      injury; and 
 
                              Annex 803.3                                   

                 (c)  if provided for by domestic law, any finding or 
                      recommendation regarding the appropriate remedy and 
                      the basis therefor.

                                       PART THREE 
                              TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE 
 
                                      Chapter Nine 
 
                               Standards-Related Measures 
 
 
            Article 901:   Scope and Coverage 
 
            1.   This Chapter applies to standards-related measures of a 
            Party, other than those covered by Section B of Chapter Seven 
            (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), that may, directly or 
            indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between the 
            Parties, and to measures of the Parties relating to such 
            measures. 
 
            2.   Technical specifications prepared by governmental bodies 
            for production or consumption requirements of such bodies shall 
            be governed exclusively by Chapter Ten (Government 
            Procurement).  
 
 
            Article 902:   Extent of Obligations 
 
            1.   Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this 
            Chapter. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to 
            ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by state or 
            provincial governments and by non-governmental standardizing 
            bodies in its territory. 
 
 
            Article 903:   Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers 
                           to Trade and Other Agreements 
 
                 Further to Article 103 (Relation to Other Agreements), the 
            Parties affirm with respect to each other their existing rights 
            and obligations relating to standards-related measures under 
            the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and all other 
            international agreements, including environmental and 
            conservation agreements, to which those Parties are party. 
 
            Article 904:   Basic Rights and Obligations 
 
            Right to Take Standards-Related Measures 
 
            1.   Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, 
            maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any 
            such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, 
            animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, 
            and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation.  
            Such measures include those to prohibit the importation of a 
            good of another Party or the provision of a service by a 
            service provider of another Party that fails to comply with the 
            applicable requirements of those measures or to complete the 
            Party's approval procedures. 
 
            Right to Establish Level of Protection 
 
            2.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each 
            Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or 
            the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the 
            environment or consumers, establish the levels of protection 
            that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 
            907(2). 
 
            Non-Discriminatory Treatment 
 
            3.   Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related 
            measures, accord to goods and service providers of another 
            Party: 
 
                 (a)  national treatment in accordance with Article 301 
                      (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade 
                      in Services); and 
 
                 (b)  treatment no less favorable than that it accords to 
                      like goods, or in like circumstances to service 
                      providers, of any other country. 
 
            Unnecessary Obstacles 
 
            4.   No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any 
            standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of 
            creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties.  
            An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be 
            created where: 
 
                 (a)  the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve 
                      a legitimate objective; and 
 
                 (b)  the measure does not operate to exclude goods of 
                      another Party that meet that legitimate objective. 
 
            Article 905:   Use of International Standards 
 
            1.   Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related 
            measures, relevant international standards or international 
            standards whose completion is imminent, except where such 
            standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to 
            fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of 
            fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or 
            infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level 
            of protection that the Party considers appropriate. 
 
            2.   A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an 
            international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with 
            Article 904(3) and (4). 
 
            3.   Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a 
            Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, 
            maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that 
            results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved 
            if the measure were based on the relevant international 
            standard. 
 
 
            Article 906:   Compatibility and Equivalence 
 
            1.   Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures 
            in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in 
            accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level 
            of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and 
            health, the environment and consumers. 
 
            2.   Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of 
            human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or 
            consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under 
            this Chapter, and taking into account international 
            standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest 
            extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards- 
            related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or 
            service between the Parties. 
 
            3.   Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, on request 
            of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to 
            promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity 
            assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with 
            the standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in 
            the territory of the other Party.  
 
            4.   Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation 
            adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to 
            its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the 
            importing Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
            importing Party that its technical regulation adequately 
            fulfills the importing Party's legitimate objectives. 
 
            5.   The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party, 
            on request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical 
            regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4. 
 
            6.   Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of 
            a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of 
            another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure 
            offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure 
            it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the 
            results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service 
            complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard 
            adopted or maintained in the Party's territory. 
 
            7.   Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment 
            procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in 
            the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment 
            results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the 
            technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies 
            involved, including verified compliance with relevant 
            international standards through such means as accreditation.  
 
 
            Article 907:   Assessment of Risk 
 
            1.   A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, 
            conduct an assessment of risk.  In conducting an assessment, a 
            Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a 
            good or service: 
 
                 (a)  available scientific evidence or technical 
                      information; 
 
                 (b)  intended end uses; 
 
                 (c)  processes or production, operating, inspection, 
                      sampling or testing methods; or  
 
                 (d)  environmental conditions. 
 
            2.   Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a 
            level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts 
            an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or 
            unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in 
            the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the 
            distinctions: 
 
                 (a)  result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination 
                      against goods or service providers of another Party; 
 
                 (b)  constitute a disguised restriction on trade between 
                      the Parties; or 
 
                 (c)  discriminate between similar goods or services for 
                      the same use under the same conditions that pose the 
                      same level of risk and provide similar benefits. 
 
            3.   Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines 
            that available scientific evidence or other information is 
            insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a 
            provisional technical regulation on the basis of available 
            relevant information.  The Party shall, within a reasonable 
            period after information sufficient to complete the assessment 
            of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review 
            and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical 
            regulation in the light of that assessment. 
 
 
            Article 908:   Conformity Assessment 
 
            1.   The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing 
            the existence of substantial differences in the structure, 
            organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures 
            in their respective territories, make compatible those 
            procedures to the greatest extent practicable.  
 
            2.   Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of 
            the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, 
            each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise 
            recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of 
            another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to 
            conformity assessment bodies in its territory. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity 
            assessment procedures: 
 
                 (a)  not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is 
                      stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than 
                      necessary to give it confidence that a good or a 
                      service conforms with an applicable technical 
                      regulation or standard, taking into account the risks 
                      that non-conformity would create; 
 
                 (b)  initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously 
                      as possible; 
 
                 (c)  in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake 
                      processing of applications in non-discriminatory 
                      order; 
 
                 (d)  publish the normal processing period for each such 
                      procedure or communicate the anticipated processing 
                      period to an applicant on request;   
 
                 (e)  ensure that the competent body 
 
                      (i)  on receipt of an application, promptly examines 
                           the completeness of the documentation and 
                           informs the applicant in a precise and complete 
                           manner of any deficiency,   
 
                      (ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible 
                           the results of the conformity assessment 
                           procedure in a form that is precise and complete 
                           so that the applicant may take any necessary 
                           corrective action,  
 
                      (iii)     where the application is deficient, 
                                proceeds as far as practicable with the 
                                procedure where the applicant so requests, 
                                and 
 
                      (iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status 
                           of the application and the reasons for any 
                           delay;  
 
                 (f)  limit the information the applicant is required to 
                      supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and 
                      to determine appropriate fees; 
 
                 (g)  accord confidential or proprietary information 
                      arising from, or supplied in connection with, the 
                      conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party 
                      or for a service provided by a person of another 
                      Party  
 
                      (i)  the same treatment as that for a good of the 
                           Party or a service provided by a person of the 
                           Party, and  
 
                      (ii) in any event, treatment that protects an 
                           applicant's legitimate commercial interests to 
                           the extent provided under the Party's law; 
 
                 (h)  ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the 
                      procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or 
                      a service provider of another Party than is equitable 
                      in relation to any such fee imposed for its like 
                      goods or service providers or for like goods or 
                      service providers of any other country, taking into 
                      account communication, transportation and other 
                      related costs;  
 
                 (i)  ensure that the location of facilities at which a 
                      conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not 
                      cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or 
                      its agent; 
 
                 (j)  limit the procedure, for a good or service modified 
                      subsequent to a determination that the good or 
                      service conforms to the applicable technical 
                      regulation or standard, to that necessary to 
                      determine that the good or service continues to 
                      conform to the technical regulation or standard; and 
 
                 (k)  limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to 
                      that which is reasonable, and ensure that the 
                      selection of samples does not cause unnecessary 
                      inconvenience to an applicant or its agent. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be 
            necessary, the relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its 
            approval procedures. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall, on request of another Party, take such 
            reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate 
            access in its territory for conformity assessment activities. 
 
            6.   Each Party shall give sympathetic consideration to a 
            request by another Party to negotiate agreements for the mutual 
            recognition of the results of that other Party's conformity 
            assessment procedures.   
 
 
            Article 909:   Notification, Publication, and Provision of 
                           Information 
 
            1.   Further to Articles 1802 (Publication) and 1803 
            (Notification and Provision of Information), each Party 
            proposing to adopt or modify a technical regulation shall:  
 
                 (a)  at least 60 days prior to the adoption or 
                      modification of the measure, other than a law, 
                      publish a notice and notify in writing the other 
                      Parties of the proposed measure in such a manner as 
                      to enable interested persons to become acquainted 
                      with the proposed measure, except that in the case of 
                      any such measure relating to perishable goods, each 
                      Party shall, to the greatest extent practicable, 
                      publish the notice and provide the notification at 
                      least 30 days prior to the adoption or modification 
                      of the measure, but no later than when notification 
                      is provided to domestic producers; 
 
                 (b)  identify in the notice and notification the good or 
                      service to which the measure would apply, and shall 
                      provide a brief description of the objective of, and 
                      reasons for the measure; 
 
                 (c)  provide a copy of the proposed measure to any Party 
                      or interested person that so requests, and shall, 
                      wherever possible, identify any provision that 
                      deviates in substance from relevant international 
                      standards; and 
 
                 (d)  without discrimination, allow other Parties and 
                      interested persons to make comments in writing and 
                      shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the 
                      comments and the results of the discussions into 
                      account. 
 
            2.   Each Party proposing to adopt or modify a standard or any 
            conformity assessment procedure not otherwise considered to be 
            a technical regulation shall, where an international standard 
            relevant to the proposed measure does not exist or such measure 
            is not substantially the same as an international standard, and 
            where the measure may have a significant effect on the trade of 
            the other Parties: 
 
                 (a)  at an early appropriate stage, publish a notice and 
                      provide a notification of the type required in 
                      paragraph 1(a) and (b); and 
 
                 (b)  observe paragraph 1(c) and (d). 
 
            3.   Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to 
            ensure, with respect to a technical regulation of a state or 
            provincial government other than a local government: 
 
                 (a)  that, at an early appropriate stage, a notice and 
                      notification of the type required under paragraph 
                      1(a) and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and 
 
                 (b)  observance of paragraph 1(c) and (d). 
 
            4.   Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent 
            problem relating to safety or to protection of human, animal or 
            plant life or health, the environment or consumers, it may omit 
            any step set out in paragraph 1 or 3, provided that on adoption 
            of a standards-related measure it shall: 
 
                 (a)  immediately provide to the other Parties a 
                      notification of the type required under paragraph 
                      1(b), including a brief description of the urgent 
                      problem; 
 
                 (b)  provide a copy of the measure to any Party or 
                      interested person that so requests; and 
 
                 (c)  without discrimination, allow other Parties and 
                      interested persons to make comments in writing, and 
                      shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the 
                      comments and the results of the discussions into 
                      account. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall, except where necessary to address an 
            urgent problem referred to in paragraph 4, allow a reasonable 
            period between the publication of a standards-related measure 
            and the date that it becomes effective to allow time for 
            interested persons to adapt to the measure. 
 
            6.   Where a Party allows non-governmental persons in its 
            territory to be present during the process of development of 
            standards-related measures, it shall also allow non- 
            governmental persons from the territories of the other Parties 
            to be present. 
 
            7.   Each Party shall notify the other Parties of the 
            development of, amendment to, or change in the application of 
            its standards-related measures no later than the time at which 
            it notifies non-governmental persons in general or the relevant 
            sector in its territory. 
 
            8.   Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to 
            ensure the observance of paragraphs 6 and 7 by a state or 
            provincial government, and by non-governmental standardizing 
            bodies in its territory. 
 
            9.   Each Party shall designate by January 1, 1994 a government 
            authority responsible for the implementation at the federal 
            level of the notification provisions of this Article, and shall 
            notify the other Parties thereof.  Where a Party designates two 
            or more government authorities for that purpose, it shall 
            provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous 
            information on the scope of responsibility of each such 
            authority. 
 
 
            Article 910:   Inquiry Points  
 
            1.   Each Party shall ensure that there is an inquiry point 
            that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other 
            Parties and interested persons, and to provide relevant 
            documents regarding: 
 
                 (a)  any standards-related measure proposed, adopted or 
                      maintained in its territory at the federal, state or 
                      provincial government level; 
 
                 (b)  the membership and participation of the Party, or its 
                      relevant federal, state or provincial government 
                      authorities, in international and regional 
                      standardizing bodies and conformity assessment 
                      systems, and in bilateral and multilateral 
                      arrangements regarding standards-related measures, 
                      and the provisions of those systems and arrangements; 
 
                 (c)  the location of notices published pursuant to Article 
                      909, or where the information can be obtained;  
 
                 (d)  the location of the inquiry points referred to in 
                      paragraph 3; and 
 
                 (e)  the Party's procedures for assessment of risk, and 
                      factors it considers in conducting the assessment and 
                      in establishing, pursuant to Article 904(2), the 
                      levels of protection that it considers appropriate. 
 
            2.   Where a Party designates more than one inquiry point, it 
            shall: 
 
                 (a)  provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous 
                      information on the scope of responsibility of each 
                      inquiry point; and 
 
                 (b)  ensure that any inquiry addressed to an incorrect 
                      inquiry point is promptly conveyed to the correct 
                      inquiry point. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be 
            available to it to ensure that there is at least one inquiry 
            point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from 
            other Parties and interested persons and to provide relevant 
            documents or information as to where they can be obtained 
            regarding: 
 
                 (a)  any standard or conformity assessment procedure 
                      proposed, adopted or maintained by non-governmental 
                      standardizing bodies in its territory; and 
 
                 (b)  the membership and participation of relevant non- 
                      governmental bodies in its territory in international 
                      and regional standardizing bodies and conformity 
                      assessment systems. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall ensure that where copies of documents are 
            requested by another Party or by interested persons in 
            accordance with this Chapter, they are supplied at the same 
            price, apart from the actual cost of delivery, as the price for 
            domestic purchase. 
 
 
            Article 911:   Technical Cooperation 
 
            1.   Each Party shall, on request of another Party: 
 
                 (a)  provide to that Party technical advice, information 
                      and assistance on mutually agreed terms and 
                      conditions to enhance that Party's standards-related 
                      measures, and related activities, processes and 
                      systems; 
 
                 (b)  provide to that Party information on its technical 
                      cooperation programs regarding standards-related 
                      measures relating to specific areas of interest; and 
 
                 (c)  consult with that Party during the development of, or 
                      prior to the adoption or change in the application 
                      of, any standards-related measure.  
 
            2.   Each Party shall encourage standardizing bodies in its 
            territory to cooperate with the standardizing bodies in the 
            territories of the other Parties in their participation, as 
            appropriate, in standardizing activities, such as through 
            membership in international standardizing bodies. 
 
 
            Article 912:   Limitations on the Provision of Information 
 
                 Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a 
            Party to: 
 
                 (a)  communicate, publish texts, or provide particulars or 
                      copies of documents other than in an official 
                      language of the Party; or 
 
                 (b)  furnish any information the disclosure of which would 
                      impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to 
                      the public interest, or would prejudice the 
                      legitimate commercial interests of particular 
                      enterprises. 
 
 
            Article 913:   Committee on Standards-Related Measures  
 
            1.   The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Standards- 
            Related Measures, comprising representatives of each Party.

            as appropriate, of representatives of state or provincial 
            governments. 
 
            7.   A Party requesting technical advice, information or

            1.   Where a Party requests consultations regarding the 
            application of this Chapter to a standards-related measure, and 
            so notifies the Committee, the Committee may facilitate the 
            consultations, if it does not consider the matter itself, by 
            referring the matter for non-binding technical advice or 
            recommendations to a subcommittee or working group, including 
            an ad hoc subcommittee or working group, or to another forum. 
 
            2.   The Committee should consider any matter referred to it 
            under paragraph 1 as expeditiously as possible and promptly 
            forward to the Parties any technical advice or recommendations

            In developing its work program, the Council may address other 
            related matters, including emissions from on-road and non-road 
            mobile sources. 
 
                             Annex 913.5.a-3

            respect to standards-related measures that are maintained by 
            state and provincial government authorities and private sector 
            organizations.  The Council shall make every effort to assist 
            these entities with such activities, especially the 
            identification of priorities and the establishment of work 
            schedules.

            from the manufacturing and retailing sectors in the territory 
            of each Party. 
 
            3.   The Subcommittee shall develop and pursue a work program 
            on the harmonization of labelling requirements to facilitate 
            trade in textile and apparel goods between the Parties through 
            the adoption of uniform labelling provisions.  The work program 
            should include the following matters: 
 
                 (a)  pictograms and symbols to replace, where possible, 
                      required written information, as well as other 
                      methods to reduce the need for labels on textile and 
                      apparel goods in multiple languages;

                      Party's national registration numbers for 
                      manufacturers or importers of textile and apparel 
                      goods.

                           construction services, and 
 
                      (iii)     for state and provincial government 
                                entities, the applicable threshold, as set 
                                out in Annex 1001.1a-3 in accordance with 
                                Article 1024. 
 
            2.   Paragraph 1 is subject to: 
 
                 (a)  the transitional provisions set out in Annex 1001.2a; 
 
                 (b)  the General Notes set out in Annex 1001.2b; and 
 
                 (c)  Annex 1001.2c, for the Parties specified therein. 
 
            3.   Subject to paragraph 4, where a contract to be awarded by 
            an entity is not covered by this Chapter, this Chapter shall 
            not be construed to cover any good or service component of that 
            contract.  
 
            4.   No Party may prepare, design or otherwise structure any 
            procurement contract in order to avoid the obligations of this 
            Chapter. 
 
            5.   Procurement includes procurement by such methods as 
            purchase, lease or rental, with or without an option to buy.  
            Procurement does not include: 
 
                 (a)  non-contractual agreements or any form of government 
                      assistance, including cooperative agreements, grants, 
                      loans, equity infusions, guarantees, fiscal 
                      incentives, and government provision of goods and 
                      services to persons or state, provincial and regional 
                      governments; and 
 
                 (b)  the acquisition of fiscal agency or depository 
                      services, liquidation and management services for 
                      regulated financial institutions and sale and 
                      distribution services for government debt. 
 
 
            Article 1002:  Valuation of Contracts 
 
            1.   Each Party shall ensure that its entities, in determining 
            whether a contract is covered by this Chapter, apply paragraphs 
            2 through 7 in calculating the value of that contract. 
 
            2.   The value of a contract shall be estimated as at the time 
            of publication of a notice in accordance with Article 1010. 
 
            3.   In calculating the value of a contract, an entity shall 
            take into account all forms of remuneration, including 
            premiums, fees, commissions and interest. 
 
            4.   Further to Article 1001(4), an entity may not select a 
            valuation method, or divide procurement requirements into 
            separate contracts, to avoid the obligations of this Chapter. 
 
            5.   Where an individual requirement for a procurement results 
            in the award of more than one contract, or in contracts being 
            awarded in separate parts, the basis for valuation shall be 
            either: 
 
                 (a)  the actual value of similar recurring contracts 
                      concluded over the prior fiscal year or 12 months 
                      adjusted, where possible, for anticipated changes in 
                      quantity and value over the subsequent 12 months; or 
 
                 (b)  the estimated value of recurring contracts in the 
                      fiscal year or 12 months subsequent to the initial 
                      contract. 
 
            6.   In the case of a contract for lease or rental, with or 
            without an option to buy, or in the case of a contract that 
            does not specify a total price, the basis for valuation shall 
            be: 
 
                 (a)  in the case of a fixed-term contract, where the term 
                      is 12 months or less, the total contract value, for 
                      its duration or, where the term exceeds 12 months, 
                      the total contract value, including the estimated 
                      residual value; or 
 
                 (b)  in the case of a contract for an indefinite period, 
                      the estimated monthly installment multiplied by 48. 
 
            If the entity is uncertain as to whether a contract is for a 
            fixed or an indefinite term, the entity shall calculate the 
            value of the contract using the method set out in subparagraph 
            (b). 
 
            7.   Where tender documentation requires option clauses, the 
            basis for valuation shall be the total value of the maximum 
            permissible procurement, including all possible optional 
            purchases. 
 
 
            Article 1003:  National Treatment and Non-Discrimination 
 
            1.   With respect to measures covered by this Chapter, each 
            Party shall accord to goods of another Party, to the suppliers 
            of such goods and to service suppliers of another Party, 
            treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment 
            that the Party accords to: 
 
                 (a)  its own goods and suppliers; and 
 
                 (b)  goods and suppliers of another Party. 
 
            2.   With respect to measures covered by this Chapter, no Party 
            may: 
 
                 (a)  treat a locally established supplier less favorably 
                      than another locally established supplier on the 
                      basis of degree of foreign affiliation or ownership; 
                      or 
 
                 (b)  discriminate against a locally established supplier 
                      on the basis that the goods or services offered by 
                      that supplier for the particular procurement are 
                      goods or services of another Party. 
 
            3.   Paragraph 1 does not apply to measures respecting customs 
            duties or other charges of any kind imposed on or in connection 
            with importation, the method of levying such duties or charges 
            or other import regulations, including restrictions and 
            formalities. 
 
 
            Article 1004:  Rules of Origin 
 
                 No Party may apply rules of origin to goods imported from 
            another Party for purposes of government procurement covered by 
            this Chapter that are different from or inconsistent with the 
            rules of origin the Party applies in the normal course of 
            trade, which may be the Marking Rules established under Annex 
            311 if they become the rules of origin applied by that Party in 
            the normal course of its trade. 
 
 
            Article 1005:  Denial of Benefits 
 
            1.   Subject to prior notification and consultation in 
            accordance with Articles 1803 (Notification and Provision of 
            Information) and 2006 (Consultations), a Party may deny the 
            benefits of this Chapter to a service supplier of another Party 
            where the Party establishes that the service is being provided 
            by an enterprise that is owned or controlled by persons of a 
            non-Party and that has no substantial business activities in 
            the territory of any Party. 
 
            2.   A Party may deny to an enterprise of another Party the 
            benefits of this Chapter if nationals of a non-Party own or 
            control the enterprise and: 
 
                 (a)  the circumstance set out in Article 1113(1)(a) 
                      (Denial of Benefits) is met; or 
 
                 (b)  the denying Party adopts or maintains measures with 
                      respect to the non-Party that prohibit transactions 
                      with the enterprise or that would be violated or 
                      circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were 
                      accorded to the enterprise. 
 
            Article 1006:  Prohibition of Offsets 
 
                 Each Party shall ensure that its entities do not, in the 
            qualification and selection of suppliers, goods or services, in 
            the evaluation of bids or the award of contracts, consider, 
            seek or impose offsets.  For purposes of this Article, offsets 
            means conditions imposed or considered by an entity prior to or 
            in the course of its procurement process that encourage local 
            development or improve its Party's balance of payments 
            accounts, by means of  requirements of local content, licensing 
            of technology, investment, counter-trade or similar 
            requirements. 
 
 
            Article 1007:  Technical Specifications 
 
            1.   Each Party shall ensure that its entities do not prepare, 
            adopt or apply any technical specification with the purpose or 
            the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall ensure that any technical specification 
            prescribed by its entities is, where appropriate: 
 
                 (a)  specified in terms of performance criteria rather 
                      than design or descriptive characteristics; and 
 
                 (b)  based on international standards, national technical 
                      regulations, recognized national standards, or 
                      building codes. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall ensure that the technical specifications 
            prescribed by its entities do not require or refer to a 
            particular trademark or name, patent, design or type, specific 
            origin or producer or supplier unless there is no sufficiently 
            precise or intelligible way of otherwise describing the 
            procurement requirements and provided that, in such cases, 
            words such as "or equivalent" are included in the tender 
            documentation. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall ensure that its entities do not seek or 
            accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding 
            competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or 
            adoption of any technical specification for a specific 
            procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest 
            in that procurement. 
 
                            Section B - Tendering Procedures 
 
 
            Article 1008:  Tendering Procedures 
 
            1.   Each Party shall ensure that the tendering procedures of 
            its entities are: 
 
                 (a)  applied in a non-discriminatory manner; and 
 
                 (b)  consistent with this Article and Articles 1009 
                      through 1016. 
 
            2.   In this regard, each Party shall ensure that its entities: 
 
                 (a)  do not provide to any supplier information with 
                      regard to a specific procurement in a manner that 
                      would have the effect of precluding competition; and 
 
                 (b)  provide all suppliers equal access to information 
                      with respect to a procurement during the period prior 
                      to the issuance of any notice or tender 
                      documentation. 
 
 
            Article 1009:  Qualification of Suppliers 
 
            1.   Further to Article 1003, no entity of a Party may, in the 
            process of qualifying suppliers in a tendering procedure, 
            discriminate between suppliers of the other Parties or between 
            domestic suppliers and suppliers of the other Parties. 
 
            2.   The qualification procedures followed by an entity shall 
            be consistent with the following: 
 
                 (a)  conditions for participation by suppliers in 
                      tendering procedures shall be published sufficiently 
                      in advance so as to provide the suppliers adequate 
                      time to initiate and, to the extent that it is 
                      compatible with efficient operation of the 
                      procurement process, to complete the qualification 
                      procedures; 
 
                 (b)  conditions for participation by suppliers in 
                      tendering procedures, including financial guarantees, 
                      technical qualifications and information necessary 
                      for establishing the financial, commercial and 
                      technical capacity of suppliers, as well as the 
                      verification of whether a supplier meets those 
                      conditions, shall be limited to those that are 
                      essential to ensure the fulfillment of the contract 
                      in question; 
 
                 (c)  the financial, commercial and technical capacity of a 
                      supplier shall be judged both on the basis of that 
                      supplier's global business activity, including its 
                      activity in the territory of the Party of the 
                      supplier, and its activity, if any, in the territory 
                      of the Party of the procuring entity; 
 
                 (d)  an entity shall not misuse the process of, including 
                      the time required for, qualification in order to 
                      exclude suppliers of another Party from a suppliers' 
                      list or from being considered for a particular 
                      procurement; 
 
                 (e)  an entity shall recognize as qualified suppliers 
                      those suppliers of another Party that meet the 
                      conditions for participation in a particular 
                      procurement; 
 
                 (f)  an entity shall consider for a particular procurement 
                      those suppliers of another Party that request to 
                      participate in the procurement and that are not yet 
                      qualified, provided there is sufficient time to 
                      complete the qualification procedure; 
 
                 (g)  an entity that maintains a permanent list of 
                      qualified suppliers shall ensure that suppliers may 
                      apply for qualification at any time, that all 
                      qualified suppliers so requesting are included in the 
                      list within a reasonably short period of time and 
                      that all qualified suppliers included in the list are 
                      notified of the termination of the list or of their 
                      removal from it; 
 
                 (h)  where, after publication of a notice in accordance 
                      with Article 1010, a supplier that is not yet 
                      qualified requests to participate in a particular 
                      procurement, the entity shall promptly start the 
                      qualification procedure; 
 
                 (i)  an entity shall advise any supplier that requests to 
                      become a qualified supplier of its decision as to 
                      whether that supplier has become qualified; and 
 
                 (j)  where an entity rejects a supplier's application to 
                      qualify or ceases to recognize a supplier as 
                      qualified, the entity shall, on request of the 
                      supplier, promptly provide pertinent information 
                      concerning the entity's reasons for doing so. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall: 
 
                 (a)  ensure that each of its entities uses a single 
                      qualification procedure, except that an entity may 
                      use additional qualification procedures where the 
                      entity determines the need for a different procedure 
                      and is prepared, on request of another Party, to 
                      demonstrate that need; and 
 
                 (b)  endeavor to minimize differences in the qualification 
                      procedures of its entities. 
 
            4.   Nothing in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall prevent an entity from 
            excluding a supplier on grounds such as bankruptcy or false 
            declarations. 
 
 
            Article 1010:  Invitation to Participate 
 
            1.   Except as otherwise provided in Article 1016, an entity 
            shall publish an invitation to participate for all procurements 
            in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 5, in the appropriate 
            publication referred to in Annex 1010.1. 
 
            2.   The invitation to participate shall take the form of a 
            notice of proposed procurement that shall contain the following 
            information: 
 
                 (a)  a description of the nature and quantity of the goods 
                      or services to be procured, including any options for 
                      further procurement and, if possible, 
 
                      (i)  an estimate of when such options may be 
                           exercised, and  
 
                      (ii) in the case of recurring contracts, an estimate 
                           of when the subsequent notices will be issued; 
 
                 (b)  a statement as to whether the procedure is open or 
                      selective and whether it will involve negotiation; 
 
                 (c)  any date for starting or completion of delivery of 
                      the goods or services to be procured; 
 
                 (d)  the address to which an application to be invited to 
                      tender or to qualify for the suppliers' lists must be 
                      submitted, the final date for receiving the 
                      application and the language or languages in which it 
                      may be submitted; 
 
                  (e)  the address to which tenders must be submitted, the 
                      final date for receiving tenders and the language or 
                      languages in which tenders may be submitted; 
 
                 (f)  the address of the entity that will award the 
                      contract and that will provide any information 
                      necessary for obtaining specifications and other 
                      documents; 
 
                 (g)  a statement of any economic or technical requirements 
                      and of any financial guarantees, information and 
                      documents required from suppliers; 
 
                 (h)  the amount and terms of payment of any sum payable 
                      for the tender documentation; and 
 
                 (i)  a statement as to whether the entity is inviting 
                      offers for purchase, lease or rental, with or without 
                      an option to buy. 
 
            3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, an entity listed in Annex 
            1001.1a-2 or 1001.1a-3 may use as an invitation to participate 
            a notice of planned procurement that shall contain as much of 
            the information referred to in paragraph 2 as is available to 
            the entity, but that shall include, at a minimum, the following 
            information:  
 
                 (a)  a description of the subject matter of the 
                      procurement; 
 
                 (b)  the time limits set for the receipt of tenders or 
                      applications to be invited to tender; 
 
                 (c)  the address to which requests for documents relating 
                      to the procurement should be submitted; 
 
                 (d)  a statement that interested suppliers should express 
                      their interest in the procurement to the entity; and 
 
                 (e)  the identification of a contact point within the 
                      entity from which further information may be 
                      obtained. 
 
            4.   An entity that uses a notice of planned procurement as an 
            invitation to participate shall subsequently invite suppliers 
            that have expressed an interest in the procurement to confirm 
            their interest on the basis of information provided by the 
            entity, which shall include at least the information referred 
            to in paragraph 2. 
   
            5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, an entity listed in Annex 
            1001.1a-2 or 1001.1a-3 may use as an invitation to participate 
            a notice regarding a qualification system.  An entity that uses 
            such a notice shall, subject to the considerations referred to 
            Article 1015(8), provide in a timely manner information that 
            allows all suppliers that have expressed an interest in 
            participating in the procurement to have a meaningful 
            opportunity to assess their interest.  The information shall 
            normally include the information required for notices referred 
            to in paragraph 2.  Information provided to any interested 
            supplier shall be provided in a non-discriminatory manner to 
            all other interested suppliers. 
 
            6.   In the case of selective tendering procedures, an entity 
            that maintains a permanent list of qualified suppliers shall 
            publish annually in the appropriate publication referred to in 
            Annex 1010.1 a notice containing the following information: 
 
                 (a)  an enumeration of any such lists maintained, 
                      including their headings, in relation to the goods or 
                      services or categories of goods or services to be 
                      procured through the lists; 
 
                 (b)  the conditions to be fulfilled by suppliers in view 
                      of their inscription on the lists and the methods 
                      according to which each of those conditions will be 
                      verified by the entity concerned; and 
 
                 (c)  the period of validity of the lists and the 
                      formalities for their renewal. 
 
            7.   Where, after publication of an invitation to participate, 
            but before the time set for the opening or receipt of tenders 
            as specified in the notices or the tender documentation, an 
            entity finds that it has become necessary to amend or reissue 
            the notice or tender documentation, the entity shall ensure 
            that the amended or reissued notice or tender documentation is 
            given the same circulation as the original.  Any significant 
            information given by an entity to a supplier with respect to a 
            particular procurement shall be given simultaneously to all 
            other interested suppliers and sufficiently in advance so as to 
            provide all suppliers concerned adequate time to consider the 
            information and to respond. 
 
            8.   An entity shall indicate in the notices referred to in 
            this Article that the procurement is covered by this Chapter. 
 
            Article 1011:  Selective Tendering Procedures 
 
            1.   To ensure optimum effective competition between the 
            suppliers of the Parties under selective tendering procedures, 
            an entity shall, for each procurement, invite tenders from the 
            maximum number of domestic suppliers and suppliers of the other 
            Parties, consistent with the efficient operation of the 
            procurement system. 
 
            2.   Subject to paragraph 3, an entity that maintains a 
            permanent list of qualified suppliers may select suppliers to 
            be invited to tender for a particular procurement from among 
            those listed.  In the process of making a selection, the entity 
            shall provide for equitable opportunities for suppliers on the 
            list. 
 
            3.   Subject to Article 1009(2)(f), an entity shall allow a 
            supplier that requests to participate in a particular 
            procurement to submit a tender and shall consider the tender.  
            The number of additional suppliers permitted to participate 
            shall be limited only by the efficient operation of the 
            procurement system. 
 
            4.   Where an entity does not invite or admit a supplier to 
            tender, the entity shall, on request of the supplier, promptly 
            provide pertinent information concerning its reasons for not 
            doing so. 
 
 
 
            Article 1012:  Time Limits for Tendering and Delivery 
 
            1.   An entity shall: 
 
                 (a)  in prescribing a time limit, provide adequate time to 
                      allow suppliers of another Party to prepare and 
                      submit tenders before the closing of the tendering 
                      procedures; 
 
                 (b)  in determining a time limit, consistent with its own 
                      reasonable needs, take into account such factors as 
                      the complexity of the procurement, the extent of 
                      subcontracting anticipated, and the time normally 
                      required for transmitting tenders by mail from 
                      foreign as well as domestic points; and 
 
                 (c)  take due account of publication delays when setting 
                      the final date for receipt of tenders or applications 
                      to be invited to tender. 
 
            2.   Subject to paragraph 3, an entity shall provide that: 
 
                 (a)  in open tendering procedures, the period for the 
                      receipt of tenders is no less than 40 days from the 
                      date of publication of a notice in accordance with 
                      Article 1010; 
 
                 (b)  in selective tendering procedures not involving the 
                      use of a permanent list of qualified suppliers, the 
                      period for submitting an application to be invited to 
                      tender is no less than 25 days from the date of 
                      publication of a notice in accordance with Article 
                      1010, and the period for receipt of tenders is no 
                      less than 40 days from the date of issuance of the 
                      invitation to tender; and 
 
                 (c)  in selective tendering procedures involving the use 
                      of a permanent list of qualified suppliers, the 
                      period for receipt of tenders is no less than 40 days 
                      from the date of the initial issuance of invitations 
                      to tender, but where the date of initial issuance of 
                      invitations to tender does not coincide with the date 
                      of publication of a notice in accordance with Article 
                      1010, there shall not be less than 40 days between 
                      those two dates. 
 
            3.   An entity may reduce the periods referred to in paragraph 
            2 in accordance with the following: 
 
                 (a)  where a notice referred to Article 1010(3) or (5) has 
                      been published for a period of no less than 40 days 
                      and no more than 12 months, the 40-day limit for 
                      receipt of tenders may be reduced to no less than 24 
                      days; 
 
                 (b)  in the case of the second or subsequent publications 
                      dealing with recurring contracts within the meaning 
                      of Article 1010(2)(a), the 40-day limit for receipt 
                      of tenders may be reduced to no less than 24 days; 
 
                 (c)  where a state of urgency duly substantiated by the 
                      entity renders impracticable the periods in question, 
                      the periods may be reduced to no less than 10 days 
                      from the date of publication of a notice in 
                      accordance with Article 1010; or 
 
                 (d)  where an entity listed in Annex 1001.1a-2 or 1001.1a- 
                      3 is using as an invitation to participate a notice 
                      referred to in Article 1010(5), the periods may be 
                      fixed by mutual agreement between the entity and all 
                      selected suppliers but, in the absence of agreement, 
                      the entity may fix periods that shall be sufficiently 
                      long to allow for responsive bidding and in any event 
                      shall be no less than 10 days. 
 
            4.   An entity shall, in establishing a delivery date for goods 
            or services and consistent with its own reasonable needs, take 
            into account such factors as the complexity of the procurement, 
            the extent of subcontracting anticipated and the time 
            realistically required for production, destocking and transport 
            of goods from the points of supply. 
 
 
            Article 1013:  Tender Documentation 
 
            1.   Where an entity provides tender documentation to 
            suppliers, the documentation shall contain all information 
            necessary to permit suppliers to submit responsive tenders, 
            including information required to be published in the notice 
            referred to in Article 1010(2), except for the information 
            required under Article 1010(2)(h).  The documentation shall 
            also include: 
 
                 (a)  the address of the entity to which tenders should be 
                      submitted; 
 
                 (b)  the address to which requests for supplementary 
                      information should be submitted; 
 
                 (c)  the language or languages in which tenders and 
                      tendering documents may be submitted; 
 
                 (d)  the closing date and time for receipt of tenders and 
                      the length of time during which tenders should be 
                      open for acceptance; 
 
                 (e)  the persons authorized to be present at the opening 
                      of tenders and the date, time and place of the 
                      opening; 
 
                 (f)  a statement of any economic or technical requirements 
                      and of any financial guarantees, information and 
                      documents required from suppliers; 
 
                 (g)  a complete description of the goods or services to be 
                      procured and any other requirements, including 
                      technical specifications, conformity certification 
                      and necessary plans, drawings and instructional 
                      materials; 
 
                 (h)  the criteria for awarding the contract, including any 
                      factors other than price that are to be considered in 
                      the evaluation of tenders and the cost elements to be 
                      included in evaluating tender prices, such as 
                      transportation, insurance and inspection costs, and 
                      in the case of goods or services of another Party, 
                      customs duties and other import charges, taxes and 
                      the currency of payment; 
 
                 (i)  the terms of payment; and 
 
                 (j)  any other terms or conditions. 
 
            2.   An entity shall: 
 
                 (a)  forward tender documentation on the request of a 
                      supplier that is participating in open tendering 
                      procedures or has requested to participate in 
                      selective tendering procedures, and reply promptly to 
                      any reasonable request for explanations relating 
                      thereto; and 
 
                 (b)  reply promptly to any reasonable request for relevant 
                      information made by a supplier participating in the 
                      tendering procedure, on condition that such 
                      information does not give that supplier an advantage 
                      over its competitors in the procedure for the award 
                      of the contract. 
 
 
            Article 1014:  Negotiation Disciplines 
 
            1.   An entity may conduct negotiations only: 
 
                 (a)  in the context of procurement in which the entity 
                      has, in a notice published in accordance with Article 
                      1010, indicated its intent to negotiate; or 
 
                 (b)  where it appears to the entity from the evaluation of 
                      the tenders that no one tender is obviously the most 
                      advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation 
                      criteria set out in the notices or tender 
                      documentation. 
 
            2.   An entity shall use negotiations primarily to identify the 
            strengths and weaknesses in the tenders. 
 
            3.   An entity shall treat all tenders in confidence.  In 
            particular, no entity may provide to any person information 
            intended to assist any supplier to bring its tender up to the 
            level of any other tender. 
 
            4.   No entity may, in the course of negotiations, discriminate 
            between suppliers.  In particular, an entity shall: 
 
                 (a)  carry out any elimination of suppliers in accordance 
                      with the criteria set out in the notices and tender 
                      documentation; 
 
                 (b)  provide in writing all modifications to the criteria 
                      or technical requirements to all suppliers remaining 
                      in the negotiations; 
 
                 (c)  permit all remaining suppliers to submit new or 
                      amended tenders on the basis of the modified criteria 
                      or requirements; and 
 
                 (d)  when negotiations are concluded, permit all remaining 
                      suppliers to submit final tenders in accordance with 
                      a common deadline. 
 
 
            Article 1015:  Submission, Receipt and Opening of Tenders and 
                           Awarding of Contracts 
 
            1.   An entity shall use procedures for the submission, receipt 
            and opening of tenders and the awarding of contracts that are 
            consistent with the following: 
 
                 (a)  tenders shall normally be submitted in writing 
                      directly or by mail; 
 
                 (b)  where tenders by telex, telegram, telecopy or other 
                      means of electronic transmission are permitted, the 
                      tender made thereby must include all the information 
                      necessary for the evaluation of the tender, in 
                      particular the definitive price proposed by the 
                      supplier and a statement that the supplier agrees to 
                      all the terms and conditions of the invitation to 
                      tender; 
 
                 (c)  a tender made by telex, telegram, telecopy or other 
                      means of electronic transmission must be confirmed 
                      promptly by letter or by the dispatch of a signed 
                      copy of the telex, telegram, telecopy or electronic 
                      message; 
 
                 (d)  the content of the telex, telegram, telecopy or 
                      electronic message shall prevail where there is a 
                      difference or conflict between that content and the 
                      content of any documentation received after the time 
                      limit for submission of tenders;  
 
                 (e)  tenders presented by telephone shall not be 
                      permitted; 
 
                 (f)  requests to participate in selective tendering 
                      procedures may be submitted by telex, telegram or 
                      telecopy and if permitted, may be submitted by other 
                      means of electronic transmission; and 
 
                 (g)  the opportunities that may be given to suppliers to 
                      correct unintentional errors of form between the 
                      opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract 
                      shall not be administered in a manner that would 
                      result in discrimination between suppliers. 
 
            In this paragraph, "means of electronic transmission" consists 
            of means capable of producing for the recipient at the 
            destination of the transmission a printed copy of the tender. 
 
            2.   No entity may penalize a supplier whose tender is received 
            in the office designated in the tender documentation after the 
            time specified for receiving tenders if the delay is due solely 
            to mishandling on the part of the entity.  An entity may also 
            consider, in exceptional circumstances, tenders received after 
            the time specified for receiving tenders if the entity's 
            procedures so provide. 
 
            3.   All tenders solicited by an entity under open or selective 
            tendering procedures shall be received and opened under 
            procedures and conditions guaranteeing the regularity of the 
            opening of tenders.  The entity shall retain the information on 
            the opening of tenders.  The information shall remain at the 
            disposal of the competent authorities of the Party for use, if 
            required, under Article 1017, Article 1019 or Chapter Twenty 
            (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement Procedures). 
 
            4.   An entity shall award contracts in accordance with the 
            following: 
 
                 (a)  to be considered for award, a tender must, at the 
                      time of opening, conform to the essential 
                      requirements of the notices or tender documentation 
                      and have been submitted by a supplier that complies 
                      with the conditions for participation; 
 
                 (b)  if the entity has received a tender that is 
                      abnormally lower in price than other tenders 
                      submitted, the entity may inquire of the supplier to 
                      ensure that it can comply with the conditions of 
                      participation and is or will be capable of fulfilling 
                      the terms of the contract; 
 
                 (c)  unless the entity decides in the public interest not 
                      to award the contract, the entity shall make the 
                      award to the supplier that has been determined to be 
                      fully capable of undertaking the contract and whose 
                      tender is either the lowest-priced tender or the 
                      tender determined to be the most advantageous in 
                      terms of the specific evaluation criteria set out in 
                      the notices or tender documentation; 
 
                 (d)  awards shall be made in accordance with the criteria 
                      and essential requirements specified in the tender 
                      documentation; and 
 
                 (e)  option clauses shall not be used in a manner that 
                      circumvents this Chapter. 
 
            5.   No entity of a Party may make it a condition of the 
            awarding of a contract that the supplier has previously been 
            awarded one or more contracts by an entity of that Party or 
            that the supplier has prior work experience in the territory of 
            that Party. 
 
            6.   An entity shall: 
 
                 (a)  on request, promptly inform suppliers participating 
                      in tendering procedures of decisions on contract 
                      awards and, if so requested, inform them in writing; 
                      and 
 
                 (b)  on request of a supplier whose tender was not 
                      selected for award, provide pertinent information to 
                      that supplier concerning the reasons for not 
                      selecting its tender, the relevant characteristics 
                      and advantages of the tender selected and the name of 
                      the winning supplier. 
 
            7.   No later than 72 days after the award of a contract, an 
            entity shall publish a notice in the appropriate publication 
            referred to in Annex 1010.1 that shall contain the following 
            information: 
 
                 (a)  a description of the nature and quantity of goods or 
                      services included in the contract; 
 
                 (b)  the name and address of the entity awarding the 
                      contract; 
 
                 (c)  the date of the award; 
 
                 (d)  the name and address of each winning supplier; 
 
                 (e)  the value of the contract, or the highest-priced and 
                      lowest-priced tenders considered in the process of 
                      awarding the contract; and 
 
                 (f)  the tendering procedure used. 
 
            8.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 through 7, an entity may 
            withhold certain information on the award of a contract where 
            disclosure of the information: 
 
                 (a)  would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary 
                      to the public interest; 
 
                 (b)  would prejudice the legitimate commercial interest of 
                      a particular person; or 
 
                 (c)  might prejudice fair competition between suppliers. 
 
 
            Article 1016:  Limited Tendering Procedures 
 
            1.   An entity of a Party may, in the circumstances and subject 
            to the conditions set out in paragraph 2, use limited tendering 
            procedures and thus derogate from Articles 1008 through 1015, 
            provided that such limited tendering procedures are not used 
            with a view to avoiding maximum possible competition or in a 
            manner that would constitute a means of discrimination between 
            suppliers of the other Parties or protection of domestic 
            suppliers. 
 
            2.   An entity may use limited tendering procedures in the 
            following circumstances and subject to the following 
            conditions, as applicable: 
 
                 (a)  in the absence of tenders in response to an open or 
                      selective tender, or where the tenders submitted 
                      either have resulted from collusion or do not conform 
                      to the essential requirements of the tender 
                      documentation, or where the tenders submitted come 
                      from suppliers that do not comply with the conditions 
                      for participation provided for in accordance with 
                      this Chapter, on condition that the requirements of 
                      the initial procurement are not substantially 
                      modified in the contract as awarded; 
 
                 (b)  where, for works of art, or for reasons connected 
                      with the protection of patents, copyrights or other 
                      exclusive rights, or proprietary information or where 
                      there is an absence of competition for technical 
                      reasons, the goods or services can be supplied only 
                      by a particular supplier and no reasonable 
                      alternative or substitute exists; 
 
                 (c)  in so far as is strictly necessary where, for reasons 
                      of extreme urgency brought about by events 
                      unforeseeable by the entity, the goods or services 
                      could not be obtained in time by means of open or 
                      selective tendering procedures; 
 
                 (d)  for additional deliveries by the original supplier 
                      that are intended either as replacement parts or 
                      continuing services for existing supplies, services 
                      or installations, or as the extension of existing 
                      supplies, services or installations, where a change 
                      of supplier would compel the entity to procure 
                      equipment or services not meeting requirements of 
                      interchangeability with already existing equipment or 
                      services, including software to the extent that the 
                      initial procurement of the software was covered by 
                      this Chapter; 
 
                 (e)  where an entity procures a prototype or a first good 
                      or service that is developed at its request in the 
                      course of and for a particular contract for research, 
                      experiment, study or original development.  Where 
                      such contracts have been fulfilled, subsequent 
                      procurement of goods or services shall be subject to 
                      Articles 1008 through 1015.  Original development of 
                      a first good may include limited production in order 
                      to incorporate the results of field testing and to 
                      demonstrate that the good is suitable for production 
                      in quantity to acceptable quality standards, but does 
                      not include quantity production to establish 
                      commercial viability or to recover research and 
                      development costs; 
 
                 (f)  for goods purchased on a commodity market; 
 
                 (g)  for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous 
                      conditions that only arise in the very short term, 
                      such as unusual disposals by enterprises that are not 
                      normally suppliers or disposal of assets of 
                      businesses in liquidation or receivership, but not 
                      routine purchases from regular suppliers;  
 
                 (h)  for a contract to be awarded to the winner of an 
                      architectural design contest, on condition that the 
                      contest is 
 
                      (i)  organized in a manner consistent with the 
                           principles of this Chapter, including regarding 
                           publication of an invitation to suitably 
                           qualified suppliers to participate in the 
                           contest, 
 
                      (ii) organized with a view to awarding the design 
                           contract to the winner, and  
 
                      (iii)     to be judged by an independent jury; and 
 
                 (i)  where an entity needs to procure consulting services 
                      regarding matters of a confidential nature, the 
                      disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to 
                      compromise government confidences, cause economic 
                      disruption or similarly be contrary to the public 
                      interest. 
 
            3.   An entity shall prepare a report in writing on each 
            contract awarded by it under paragraph 2.  Each report shall 
            contain the name of the procuring entity, indicate the value 
            and kind of goods or services procured, the name of the country 
            of origin, and a statement indicating the circumstances and 
            conditions described in paragraph 2 that justified the use of 
            limited tendering.  The entity shall retain each report.  They 
            shall remain at the disposal of the competent authorities of 
            the Party for use, if required, under Article 1017, Article 
            1019 or Chapter Twenty (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute 
            Settlement Procedures). 
 
 
                               Section C - Bid Challenge 
 
 
            Article 1017:  Bid Challenge 
 
            1.   In order to promote fair, open and impartial procurement 
            procedures, each Party shall adopt and maintain bid challenge 
            procedures for procurement covered by this Chapter in 
            accordance with the following: 
 
                 (a)  each Party shall allow suppliers to submit bid 
                      challenges concerning any aspect of the procurement 
                      process, which for the purposes of this Article 
                      begins after an entity has decided on its procurement 
                      requirement and continues through the contract award; 
 
                 (b)  a Party may encourage a supplier to seek a resolution 
                      of any complaint with the entity concerned prior to 
                      initiating a bid challenge; 
 
                 (c)  each Party shall ensure that its entities accord fair 
                      and timely consideration to any complaint regarding 
                      procurement covered by this Chapter; 
 
                 (d)  whether or not a supplier has attempted to resolve 
                      its complaint with the entity, or following an 
                      unsuccessful attempt at such a resolution, no Party 
                      may prevent the supplier from initiating a bid 
                      challenge or seeking any other relief; 
 
                 (e)  a Party may require a supplier to notify the entity 
                      on initiation of a bid challenge; 
 
                 (f)  a Party may limit the period within which a supplier 
                      may initiate a bid challenge, but in no case shall 
                      the period be less than 10 working days from the time 
                      when the basis of the complaint became known or 
                      reasonably should have become known to the supplier; 
 
                 (g)  each Party shall establish or designate a reviewing 
                      authority with no substantial interest in the outcome 
                      of procurements to receive bid challenges and make 
                      findings and recommendations concerning them; 
 
                 (h)  on receipt of a bid challenge, the reviewing 
                      authority shall expeditiously investigate the 
                      challenge; 
 
                 (i)  a Party may require its reviewing authority to limit 
                      its considerations to the challenge itself; 
 
                 (j)  in investigating the challenge, the reviewing 
                      authority may delay the awarding of the proposed 
                      contract pending resolution of the challenge, except 
                      in cases of urgency or where the delay would be 
                      contrary to the public interest; 
 
                 (k)  the reviewing authority shall issue a recommendation 
                      to resolve the challenge, which may include directing 
                      the entity to re-evaluate offers, terminate or 
                      re-compete the contract in question; 
 
                 (l)  entities normally shall follow the recommendations of 
                      the reviewing authority; 
 
                 (m)  each Party should authorize its reviewing authority, 
                      following the conclusion of a bid challenge 
                      procedure, to make additional recommendations in 
                      writing to an entity respecting any facet of the 
                      entity's procurement process that is identified as 
                      problematic during the investigation of the 
                      challenge, including recommendations for changes in 
                      the procurement procedures of the entity to bring 
                      them into conformity with this Chapter; 
 
                 (n)  the reviewing authority shall provide its findings 
                      and recommendations respecting bid challenges in 
                      writing and in a timely manner, and shall make them 
                      available to the Parties and interested persons; 
 
                 (o)  each Party shall specify in writing and shall make 
                      generally available all its bid challenge procedures; 
                      and 
 
                 (p)  each Party shall ensure that each of its entities 
                      maintains complete documentation regarding each of 
                      its procurements, including a written record of all 
                      communications substantially affecting each 
                      procurement, for at least three years from the date 
                      the contract was awarded, to allow verification that 
                      the procurement process was carried out in accordance 
                      with this Chapter. 
 
            2.   A Party may require that a bid challenge be initiated only 
            after the notice of procurement has been published or, where a 
            notice is not published, after tender documentation has been 
            made available.  Where a Party imposes such a requirement, 
            the 10-working day period described in paragraph 1(f) shall 
            begin no earlier than the date that the notice is published or 
            the tender documentation is made available. 
 
 
                             Section D - General Provisions 
 
 
            Article 1018:  Exceptions 
 
            1.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a 
            Party from taking any action or not disclosing any information 
            which it considers necessary for the protection of its 
            essential security interests relating to the procurement of 
            arms, ammunition or war materials, or to procurement 
            indispensable for national security or for national defense 
            purposes. 
 
            2.   Provided that such measures are not applied in a manner 
            that would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable 
            discrimination between Parties where the same conditions 
            prevail or a disguised restriction on trade between the 
            Parties, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent 
            any Party from adopting or maintaining measures: 
 
                 (a)  necessary to protect public morals, order or safety; 
 
                 (b)  necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or 
                      health; 
 
                 (c)  necessary to protect intellectual property; or  
 
                 (d)  relating to goods or services of handicapped persons, 
                      of philanthropic institutions or of prison labor. 
 
 
            Article 1019:  Provision of Information 
 
            1.   Further to Article 1802(1) (Publication), each Party shall 
            promptly publish any law, regulation, precedential judicial 
            decision, administrative ruling of general application and any 
            procedure, including standard contract clauses, regarding 
            government procurement covered by this Chapter in the 
            appropriate publications referred to in Annex 1010.1. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall: 
 
                 (a)  on request, explain to another Party its government 
                      procurement procedures; 
 
                 (b)  ensure that its entities, on request from a supplier, 
                      promptly explain their procurement practices and 
                      procedures; and 
 
                 (c)  designate by January 1, 1994 one or more contact 
                      points to 
 
                      (i)  facilitate communication between the Parties, 
                           and 
 
                      (ii) answer, on request, all reasonable inquiries 
                           from other Parties to provide relevant 
                           information on matters covered by this Chapter. 
 
            3.   A Party may seek such additional information on the award 
            of the contract as may be necessary to determine whether the 
            procurement was made fairly and impartially, in particular with 
            respect to unsuccessful tenders.  To this end, the Party of the 
            procuring entity shall provide information on the 
            characteristics and relative advantages of the winning tender 
            and the contract price.  Where release of this information 
            would prejudice competition in future tenders, the information 
            shall not be released by the requesting Party except after 
            consultation with and agreement of the Party that provided the 
            information. 
 
            4.   On request, each Party shall provide to another Party 
            information available to that Party and its entities concerning 
            covered procurement of its entities and the individual 
            contracts awarded by its entities. 
 
            5.   No Party may disclose confidential information the 
            disclosure of which would prejudice the legitimate commercial 
            interests of a particular person or might prejudice fair 
            competition between suppliers, without the formal authorization 
            of the person that provided the information to that Party. 
 
            6.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as requiring 
            any Party to disclose confidential information the disclosure 
            of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary 
            to the public interest. 
 
            7.   With a view to ensuring effective monitoring of 
            procurement covered by this Chapter, each Party shall collect 
            statistics and provide to the other Parties an annual report in 
            accordance with the following reporting requirements, unless 
            the Parties otherwise agree: 
 
                 (a)  statistics on the estimated value of all contracts 
                      awarded, both above and below the applicable 
                      threshold values, broken down by entities; 
 
                 (b)  statistics on the number and total value of contracts 
                      above the applicable threshold values, broken down by 
                      entities, by categories of goods or services 
                      established in accordance with classification systems 
                      developed under this Chapter and by the country of 
                      origin of the goods and services procured; 
 
                 (c)  statistics on the number and total value of contracts 
                      awarded under each use of the procedures referred to 
                      in Article 1016, broken down by entities, by 
                      categories of goods or services, and by country of 
                      origin of the goods and services procured; and 
 
                 (d)  statistics on the number and total value of contracts 
                      awarded under derogations to this Chapter set out in 
                      Annexes 1001.2a and 1001.2b, broken down by entities. 
 
            8.   Each Party may organize by state or province any portion 
            of a report referred to in paragraph 7 that pertains to 
            entities listed in Annex 1001.1a-3. 
 
 
            Article 1020:  Technical Cooperation 
 
            1.   The Parties shall cooperate, on mutually agreed terms, to 
            increase understanding of their respective government 
            procurement systems, with a view to maximizing access to 
            government procurement opportunities for the suppliers of all 
            Parties. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide to the other Parties and to the 
            suppliers of such Parties, on a cost recovery basis, 
            information concerning training and orientation programs 
            regarding its government procurement system, and access on a 
            non-discriminatory basis to any program it conducts. 
 
            3.   The training and orientation programs referred to in 
            paragraph 2 include: 
 
                 (a)  training of government personnel directly involved in 
                      government procurement procedures; 
 
                 (b)  training of suppliers interested in pursuing 
                      government procurement opportunities; 
 
                 (c)  an explanation and description of specific elements 
                      of each Party's government procurement system, such 
                      as its bid challenge mechanism; and 
 
                 (d)  information about government procurement market 
                      opportunities. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall establish by January 1, 1994 at least one 
            contact point to provide information on the training and 
            orientation programs referred to in this Article. 
 
 
            Article 1021:  Joint Programs for Small Business  
 
            1.   The Parties shall establish, within 12 months after the 
            date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Committee on 
            Small Business, comprising representatives of the Parties.  The 
            Committee shall meet as mutually agreed, but not less than once 
            each year, and shall report annually to the Commission on the 
            efforts of the Parties to promote government procurement 
            opportunities for their small businesses. 
 
            2.   The Committee shall work to facilitate the following 
            activities of the Parties: 
 
                 (a)  identification of available opportunities for the 
                      training of small business personnel in government 
                      procurement procedures; 
 
                 (b)  identification of small businesses interested in 
                      becoming trading partners of small businesses in the 
                      territory of another Party; 
 
                 (c)  development of data bases of small businesses in the 
                      territory of each Party for use by entities of 
                      another Party wishing to procure from small 
                      businesses;  
 
                 (d)  consultations regarding the factors that each Party 
                      uses in establishing its criteria for eligibility for 
                      any small business programs; and 
 
                 (e)  activities to address any related matter. 
 
 
            Article 1022:  Rectifications or Modifications 
 
            1.   A Party may modify its coverage under this Chapter only in 
            exceptional circumstances. 
 
            2.   Where a Party modifies its coverage under this Chapter, 
            the Party shall: 
 
                 (a)  notify the other Parties and its Section of the 
                      Secretariat of the modification; 
 
                 (b)  reflect the change in the appropriate Annex; and 
 
                 (c)  propose to the other Parties appropriate compensatory 
                      adjustments to its coverage in order to maintain a 
                      level of coverage comparable to that existing prior 
                      to the modification. 
 
            3.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may make 
            rectifications of a purely formal nature and minor amendments 
            to its Schedules to Annexes 1001.1a-1 through 1001.1b-3 and 
            Annexes 1001.2a and 1001.2b, provided that it notifies such 
            rectifications to the other Parties and its Section of the 
            Secretariat, and another Party does not object to such proposed 
            rectification within 30 days.  In such cases, compensation need 
            not be proposed. 
 
            4.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a 
            Party may undertake reorganizations of its government 
            procurement entities covered by this Chapter, including 
            programs through which the procurement of such entities is 
            decentralized or the corresponding government functions cease 
            to be performed by any government entity, whether or not 
            subject to this Chapter.  In such cases, compensation need not 
            be proposed.  No Party may undertake such reorganizations or 
            programs to avoid the obligations of this Chapter. 
 
            5.   Where a Party considers that: 
 
                 (a)  an adjustment proposed under paragraph (2)(c) is not 
                      adequate to maintain a comparable level of mutually 
                      agreed coverage, or 
 
                 (b)  a rectification or a minor amendment under paragraph 
                      3 or a reorganization under paragraph 4 does not meet 
                      the applicable requirements of those paragraphs and 
                      should require compensation, 
 
            the Party may have recourse to dispute settlement procedures 
            under Chapter Twenty (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute 
            Settlement Procedures). 
 
 
            Article 1023:  Divestiture of Entities 
 
            1.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a 
            Party from divesting an entity covered by this Chapter. 
 
            2.   If, on the public offering of shares of an entity listed 
            in Annex 1001.1a-2, or through other methods, the entity is no 
            longer subject to federal government control, the Party may 
            delete the entity from its Schedule to that Annex, and withdraw 
            the entity from the coverage of this Chapter, on notification 
            to the other Parties and its Section of the Secretariat. 
 
            3.   Where a Party objects to the withdrawal on the grounds 
            that the entity remains subject to federal government control, 
            that Party may have recourse to dispute settlement procedures 
            under Chapter Twenty (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute 
            Settlement Procedures). 
 
 
            Article 1024:  Further Negotiations 
 
            1.   The Parties shall commence further negotiations no later 
            than December 31, 1998, with a view to the further 
            liberalization of their respective government procurement 
            markets.  
 
            2.   In such negotiations, the Parties shall review all aspects 
            of their government procurement practices for purposes of: 
 
                 (a)  assessing the functioning of their government 
                      procurement systems; 
 
                 (b)  seeking to expand the coverage of this Chapter, 
                      including by adding 
 
                      (i)  other government enterprises, and 
 
                      (ii) procurement otherwise subject to legislated or 
                           administrative exceptions; and 
 
                 (c)  reviewing thresholds. 
 
            3.   Prior to such review, the Parties shall endeavor to 
            consult with their state and provincial governments with a view 
            to obtaining commitments, on a voluntary and reciprocal basis, 
            to include within this Chapter procurement by state and 
            provincial government entities and enterprises. 
 
            4.   If the negotiations pursuant to Article IX:6(b) of the 
            GATT Agreement on Government Procurement ("the Code") are 
            completed prior to such review, the Parties shall: 
 
                 (a)  immediately begin consultations with their state and 
                      provincial governments with a view to obtaining 
                      commitments, on a voluntary and reciprocal basis, to 
                      include within this Chapter procurement by state and 
                      provincial government entities and enterprises; and 
 
                 (b)  increase the obligations and coverage of this Chapter 
                      to a level at least commensurate with that of the 
                      Code. 
 
            5.   The Parties shall undertake further negotiations, to 
            commence no later than one year after the date of entry into 
            force of this Agreement, on the subject of electronic 
            transmission.

                 services. 
 
            R&D Codes: 
 
                 The R&D code is composed of two alphabetic digits.  The 
                 first digit is always the letter "A" to identify R&D, the 
                 second digit is alphabetic "A to Z" to identify the major 
                 sub-group.

                 for the owner of the project, or on own account; or by 
                 subcontracting parts of the construction work to 
                 contractors specializing, e.g., in installation work, 
                 where the value of work done by subcontractors becomes 
                 part of the main contractor s work.  The products 
                 classified here are services which are essential in the 
                 production process of the different types of 
                 constructions, the final output of construction 
                 activities.

                        Indexation and Conversion of Thresholds 
 
            1.   The calculations referred to in Article 1001(1)(c) (Scope 
            and Coverage) shall be made in accordance with the following: 
 
                 (a)  the U.S. inflation rate shall be measured by the 
                      Producer Price Index for Finished Goods published by 
                      the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
 
                 (b)  the first adjustment for inflation, to take effect on 
                      January 1, 1996, shall be calculated using the period 
                      from November 1, 1993 through October 31, 1995; 
 
                 (c)  all subsequent adjustments shall be calculated using 
                      two-year periods, each period beginning November 1, 
                      and shall take effect on January 1 of the year 
                      immediately following the end of the two-year period; 
 
                 (d)  the United States shall notify the other Parties of 
                      the adjusted threshold values no later than November 
                      16 of the year before the adjustment takes effect; 
                      and 
 
                 (e)  the inflationary adjustment shall be estimated 
                      according to the following formula 
 
                                   T0 x (1+  i) = T1 
 
                      T0=  threshold value at base period 
                       i=  accumulated U.S. inflation rate for the ith two 
                           year-period 
                      T1=  new threshold value. 
 
            2.   Mexico and Canada shall calculate and convert the value of 
            the thresholds set out in Article 1001(1)(c) into their 
            national currencies using the conversion formula set out in 
            paragraph 3 or 4, as appropriate.  Mexico and Canada shall 
            notify each other and the United States of the value, in their 
            respective currencies, of the newly calculated thresholds no 
            later than one month before the respective thresholds take 
            effect. 
 
            3.   Canada shall base its calculation on the official 
            conversion rates of the Bank of Canada.  From January 1, 1994 
            through December 31, 1995, the conversion rate shall be the 
            average of the weekly values of the Canadian dollar in terms of 
 
                                    Annex 1001.1c 
 
            the U.S. dollar over the period October 1, 1992 through 
            September 30, 1993.  For each subsequent two-year period 
            beginning January 1, 1996, its conversion rate shall be the 
            average of the weekly values of the Canadian dollar in terms of 
            the U.S. dollar over the two-year period ending September 30 of 
            the year preceding the beginning of each two-year period. 
 
            4.   Mexico shall use the conversion rate of the Bank of Mexico 
            ("Banco de M xico").  Its conversion rate shall be the existing 
            value of the Mexican peso in terms of the U.S. dollar as of 
            December 1 and June 1 of each year, or the first working day 
            thereafter.  The conversion rate as of December 1 shall apply 
            from January 1 to June 30 of the following year, and as of June 
            1 shall apply from July 1 to December 31 of that year.

            original dollar values multiplied by the ratio of: 
 
                 (a)  the implicit U.S. GDP price deflator or any successor 
                      index published by the Council of Economic Advisors 
                      in "Economic Indicators", current as of January of 
                      that year, to  
 
                 (b)  the implicit U.S. GDP price deflator or any successor 
                      index published by the Council of Economic Advisors 
                      in "Economic Indicators", current as of the date of 
                      entry into force of this Agreement, 
 
            provided that the price deflators under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
            have the same base year. 
 
            The resulting adjusted dollar values shall be rounded to the 
            nearest million dollars.   
 
            5.   National security exceptions include procurements made in 
            support of safeguarding nuclear materials or technology. 
 
            6.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, an 
            entity may impose a local content requirement of no more than: 
 
                 (a)  40 percent, for labor-intensive turnkey or major 
                      integrated projects; or 
 
                 (b)  25 percent, for capital-intensive turnkey or major 
                      integrated projects. 
 
            For purposes of this paragraph, a turnkey or major integrated 
            project means, in general, a construction, supply or 
            installation project undertaken by a person pursuant to a right 
            granted by an entity with respect to which: 
 
                           Annex 1001.2b 
 
                 (c)  the prime contractor is vested with the authority to 
                      select the general contractors or subcontractors;  
 
                 (d)  neither the Government of Mexico nor its entities 
                      fund the project;  
 
                 (e)  the person bears the risks associated with non- 
                      performance; and  
 
                 (f)  the facility will be operated by an entity or through 
                      a procurement contract of that entity. 
 
            7.   Notwithstanding the thresholds set out in Article 
            1001(1)(c), Article 1003 shall apply to any procurement from 
            locally-established suppliers of oil and gas field supplies or 
            equipment by Pemex at any project site where it performs works. 

 
 
            8.   In the event that Mexico exceeds in any given year the 
            total value of the contracts it may set aside for that year in 
            accordance with paragraph 3 or the reserved procurement under 
            Annex 1001.2a(1)(2) or (4), Mexico shall consult with the other 
            Parties with a view to agreement on compensation in the form of 
            additional procurement opportunities during the following year. 

            The consultations shall be without prejudice to the rights of 
            any Party under Chapter Twenty (Institutional Arrangements and 
            Dispute Settlement Procedures). 
 
            9.   Notwithstanding Annex 1001.2a(6), Mexico may not set aside 
            from the obligations of this Chapter procurement contracts by 
            its entities of biologicals and drugs patented in Mexico.   
 
            10.  Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require 
            Pemex to enter into risk-sharing contracts. 
 
                             Schedule of the United States 
 
            1.   This Chapter does not apply to set asides on behalf of 
            small and minority businesses. 
 
            2.   This Chapter does not apply to the procurement of 
            transportation services that form a part of, or are incidental 
            to, a procurement contract. 
 
            3.   The most-favored-nation obligation of Article 1003 does 
            not apply to procurements covered by Annex 1001.2c. 
 
                                     Annex 1001.2c 
 
                              Country-Specific Thresholds 
 
                 As between Canada and United States, 
 
                 (a)  for any entity listed in the Schedule of Canada or of 
                      the United States in Annex 1001.1a-1, the applicable 
                      threshold for goods contracts, which may include 
                      incidental services such as delivery and 
                      transportation, shall be US$25,000 and the equivalent 
                      in Canadian dollars, as the case may be; 
 
                 (b)  Annex 1001.1c, except paragraphs 2 and 3 of that 
                      Annex for the purpose of calculating and converting 
                      the value of the threshold set out in subparagraph 
                      (a), does not apply to such goods contracts; and 
 
                 (c)  Chapter Thirteen of the Canada - United States Free 
                      Trade Agreement shall govern any procurement 
                      procedures that began before January 1, 1994, and 
                      that Chapter is hereby incorporated and made a part 
                      of this Agreement solely for that purpose.

                                     Chapter Eleven 
 
                                       Investment 
 
                                 Section A - Investment 
 
 
            Article 1101:  Scope and Coverage 
 
            1.   This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by 
            a Party relating to: 
 
                 (a)  investors of another Party; 
 
                 (b)  investments of investors of another Party in the 
                      territory of the Party; and 
 
                 (c)  with respect to Articles 1106 and 1114, all 
                      investments in the territory of the Party. 
 
            2.   A Party has the right to perform exclusively the economic 
            activities set out in Annex III and to refuse to permit the 
            establishment of investment in such activities. 
 
            3.   This Chapter does not apply to measures adopted or 
            maintained by a Party to the extent that they are covered by 
            Chapter Fourteen (Financial Services). 
 
            4.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a 
            Party from providing a service or performing a function such as 
            law enforcement, correctional services, income security or 
            insurance, social security or insurance, social welfare, public 
            education, public training, health, and child care, in a manner 
            that is not inconsistent with this Chapter. 
 
 
            Article 1102:  National Treatment 
 
            1.   Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party 
            treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like 
            circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the 
            establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, 
            operation, and sale or other disposition of investments. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of 
            another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, 
            in like circumstances, to investments of its own investors with 
            respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, 
            management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition 
            of investments. 
 
            3.   The treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 
            means, with respect to a state or province, treatment no less 
            favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded, in like 
            circumstances, by that state or province to investors, and to 
            investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a 
            part. 
 
            4.   For greater certainty, no Party may: 
 
                 (a)  impose on an investor of another Party a requirement 
                      that a minimum level of equity in an enterprise in 
                      the territory of the Party be held by its nationals, 
                      other than nominal qualifying shares for directors or 
                      incorporators of corporations; or 
 
                 (b)  require an investor of another Party, by reason of 
                      its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an 
                      investment in the territory of the Party. 
 
 
            Article 1103:  Most-Favored-Nation Treatment 
 
            1.   Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party 
            treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like 
            circumstances, to investors of any other Party or of a non- 
            Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, 
            expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other 
            disposition of investments. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of 
            another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, 
            in like circumstances, to investments of investors of any other 
            Party or of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, 
            acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and 
            sale or other disposition of investments. 
 
 
            Article 1104:  Standard of Treatment 
 
                 Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party and 
            to investments of investors of another Party the better of the 
            treatment required by Articles 1102 and 1103. 
 
            Article 1105:  Minimum Standard of Treatment 
 
            1.   Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of 
            another Party treatment in accordance with international law, 
            including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and 
            security. 
 
            2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1 and notwithstanding 
            Article 1108(7)(b), each Party shall accord to investors of 
            another Party, and to investments of investors of another 
            Party, non-discriminatory treatment with respect to measures it 
            adopts or maintains relating to losses suffered by investments 
            in its territory owing to armed conflict or civil strife. 
 
            3.   Paragraph 2 does not apply to existing measures relating 
            to subsidies or grants that would be inconsistent with Article 
            1102 but for Article 1108(7)(b). 
 
 
            Article 1106:  Performance Requirements 
 
            1.   No Party may impose or enforce any of the following 
            requirements, or enforce any commitment or undertaking, in 
            connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, 
            management, conduct or operation of an investment of an 
            investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory: 
 
                 (a)  to export a given level or percentage of goods or 
                      services; 
 
                 (b)  to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic 
                      content; 
 
                 (c)  to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods 
                      produced or services provided in its territory, or to 
                      purchase goods or services from persons in its 
                      territory; 
 
                 (d)  to relate in any way the volume or value of imports 
                      to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of 
                      foreign exchange inflows associated with such 
                      investment; 
 
                 (e)  to restrict sales of goods or services in its 
                      territory that such investment produces or provides 
                      by relating such sales in any way to the volume or 
                      value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings; 
 
                 (f)  to transfer technology, a production process or other 
                      proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory, 
                      except when the requirement is imposed or the 
                      commitment or undertaking is enforced by a court, 
                      administrative tribunal or competition authority to 
                      remedy an alleged violation of competition laws or to 
                      act in a manner not inconsistent with other 
                      provisions of this Agreement; or 
 
                 (g)  to act as the exclusive supplier of the goods it 
                      produces or services it provides to a specific region 
                      or world market. 
 
            2.   A measure that requires an investment to use a technology 
            to meet generally applicable health, safety or environmental 
            requirements shall not be construed to be inconsistent with 
            paragraph 1(f).  For greater certainty, Articles 1102 and 1103 
            apply to the measure. 
 
            3.   No Party may condition the receipt or continued receipt of 
            an advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory 
            of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party, on compliance with 
            any of the following requirements: 
 
                 (a)  to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic 
                      content; 
 
                 (b)  to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods 
                      produced in its territory, or to purchase goods from 
                      producers in its territory; 
 
                 (c)  to relate in any way the volume or value of imports 
                      to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of 
                      foreign exchange inflows associated with such 
                      investment; or 
 
                 (d)  to restrict sales of goods or services in its 
                      territory that such investment produces or provides 
                      by relating such sales in any way to the volume or 
                      value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings. 
 
            4.   Nothing in paragraph 3 shall be construed to prevent a 
            Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an 
            advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory of 
            an investor of a Party or of a non-Party, on compliance with a 
            requirement to locate production, provide a service, train or 
            employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or 
            carry out research and development, in its territory. 
 
            5.   Paragraphs 1 and 3 do not apply to any requirement other 
            than the requirements set out in those paragraphs. 
 
            6.   Provided that such measures are not applied in an 
            arbitrary or unjustifiable manner, or do not constitute a 
            disguised restriction on international trade or investment, 
            nothing in paragraph 1(b) or (c) or 3(a) or (b) shall be 
            construed to prevent any Party from adopting or maintaining 
            measures, including environmental measures: 
 
                 (a)  necessary to secure compliance with laws and 
                      regulations that are not inconsistent with the 
                      provisions of this Agreement; 
 
                 (b)  necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or 
                      health; or 
 
                 (c)  necessary for the conservation of living or non- 
                      living exhaustible natural resources. 
 
 
            Article 1107:  Senior Management and Boards of Directors 
 
            1.   No Party may require that an enterprise of that Party that 
            is an investment of an investor of another Party appoint to 
            senior management positions individuals of any particular 
            nationality. 
 
            2.   A Party may require that a majority of the board of 
            directors, or any committee thereof, of an enterprise of that 
            Party that is an investment of an investor of another Party, be 
            of a particular nationality, or resident in the territory of 
            the Party, provided that the requirement does not materially 
            impair the ability of the investor to exercise control over its 
            investment. 
 
 
            Article 1108:  Reservations and Exceptions  
 
            1.   Articles 1102, 1103, 1106 and 1107 do not apply to: 
 
                 (a)  any existing non-conforming measure that is 
                      maintained by 
 
                      (i)  a Party at the federal level, as set out in its 
                           Schedule to Annex I or III, 
 
                      (ii) a state or province, for two years after the 
                           date of entry into force of this Agreement, and 
                           thereafter as set out by a Party in its Schedule 
                           to Annex I in accordance with paragraph 2, or 
 
                      (iii)     a local government; 
 
                 (b)  the continuation or prompt renewal of any 
                      non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph 
                      (a); or 
 
                 (c)  an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred 
                      to in subparagraph (a) to the extent that the 
                      amendment does not decrease the conformity of the 
                      measure, as it existed immediately before the 
                      amendment, with Articles 1102, 1103, 1106 and 1107. 
 
            2.   Each Party may set out in its Schedule to Annex I, within 
            two years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, 
            any existing non-conforming measure maintained by a state or 
            province, not including a local government. 
 
            3.   Articles 1102, 1103, 1106 and 1107 do not apply to any 
            measure that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to 
            sectors, subsectors or activities, as set out in its Schedule 
            to Annex II. 
 
            4.   No Party may, under any measure adopted after the date of 
            entry into force of this Agreement and covered by its Schedule 
            to Annex II, require an investor of another Party, by reason of 
            its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment 
            existing at the time the measure becomes effective. 
 
            5.   Articles 1102 and 1103 do not apply to any measure that is 
            an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations under 
            Article 1703 (Intellectual Property - National Treatment) as 
            specifically provided for in that Article. 
 
            6.   Article 1103 does not apply to treatment accorded by a 
            Party pursuant to agreements, or with respect to sectors, set 
            out in its Schedule to Annex IV. 
 
            7.   Articles 1102, 1103 and 1107 do not apply to: 
 
                 (a)  procurement by a Party or a state enterprise; or 
 
                 (b)  subsidies or grants provided by a Party or a state 
                      enterprise, including government-supported loans, 
                      guarantees and insurance. 
 
            8.   The provisions of: 
 
                 (a)  Article 1106(1)(a), (b) and (c), and (3)(a) and (b) 
                      do not apply to qualification requirements for goods 
                      or services with respect to export promotion and 
                      foreign aid programs; 
 
                 (b)  Article 1106(1)(b), (c), (f) and (g), and (3)(a) and 
                      (b) do not apply to procurement by a Party or a state 
                      enterprise; and 
 
                 (c)  Article 1106(3)(a) and (b) do not apply to 
                      requirements imposed by an importing Party relating 
                      to the content of goods necessary to qualify for 
                      preferential tariffs or preferential quotas. 
 
 
 
            Article 1109:  Transfers 
 
            1.   Each Party shall permit all transfers relating to an 
            investment of an investor of another Party in the territory of 
            the Party to be made freely and without delay.  Such transfers 
            include: 
 
                 (a)  profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty 
                      payments, management fees, technical assistance and 
                      other fees, returns in kind and other amounts derived 
                      from the investment; 
 
                 (b)  proceeds from the sale of all or any part of the 
                      investment or from the partial or complete 
                      liquidation of the investment; 
 
                 (c)  payments made under a contract entered into by the 
                      investor, or its investment, including payments made 
                      pursuant to a loan agreement; 
 
                 (d)  payments made pursuant to Article 1110; and 
 
                 (e)  payments arising under Section B. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall permit transfers to be made in a freely 
            usable currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on 
            the date of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the 
            currency to be transferred. 
 
            3.   No Party may require its investors to transfer, or 
            penalize its investors that fail to transfer, the income, 
            earnings, profits or other amounts derived from, or 
            attributable to, investments in the territory of another Party. 
 
            4.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent a 
            transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good 
            faith application of its laws relating to: 
 
                 (a)  bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the 
                      rights of creditors; 
  
                 (b)  issuing, trading or dealing in securities; 
 
                 (c)  criminal or penal offenses; 
 
                 (d)  reports of transfers of currency or other monetary 
                      instruments; or 
 
                 (e)  ensuring the satisfaction of judgments in 
                      adjudicatory proceedings. 
 
            5.   Paragraph 3 shall not be construed to prevent a Party from 
            imposing any measure through the equitable, non-discriminatory 
            and good faith application of its laws relating to the matters 
            set out in subparagraphs (a) through (e) of paragraph 4. 
 
            6.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may restrict 
            transfers of returns in kind in circumstances where it could 
            otherwise restrict such transfers under this Agreement, 
            including as set out in paragraph 4. 
 
 
            Article 1110:  Expropriation and Compensation 
 
            1.   No Party may directly or indirectly nationalize or 
            expropriate an investment of an investor of another Party in 
            its territory or take a measure tantamount to nationalization 
            or expropriation of such an investment ("expropriation"), 
            except: 
 
                 (a)  for a public purpose; 
 
                 (b)  on a non-discriminatory basis; 
 
                 (c)  in accordance with due process of law and Article 
                      1105(1); and 
 
                 (d)  on payment of compensation in accordance with 
                      paragraphs 2 through 6. 
 
            2.   Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value 
            of the expropriated investment immediately before the 
            expropriation took place ("date of expropriation"), and shall 
            not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended 
            expropriation had become known earlier.  Valuation criteria 
            shall include going concern value, asset value including 
            declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as 
            appropriate, to determine fair market value. 
 
            3.   Compensation shall be paid without delay and be fully 
            realizable. 
 
            4.   If payment is made in a G7 currency, compensation shall 
            include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that 
            currency from the date of expropriation until the date of 
            actual payment. 
 
            5.   If a Party elects to pay in a currency other than a G7 
            currency, the amount paid on the date of payment, if converted 
            into a G7 currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on 
            that date, shall be no less than if the amount of compensation 
            owed on the date of expropriation had been converted into that 
            G7 currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that 
            date, and interest had accrued at a commercially reasonable 
            rate for that G7 currency from the date of expropriation until 
            the date of payment. 
 
            6.   On payment, compensation shall be freely transferable as 
            provided in Article 1109. 
 
            7.   This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory 
            licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, 
            or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual 
            property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, 
            limitation or creation is consistent with Chapter Seventeen 
            (Intellectual Property). 
 
            8.   For purposes of this Article and for greater certainty, a 
            non-discriminatory measure of general application shall not be 
            considered a measure tantamount to an expropriation of a debt 
            security or loan covered by this Chapter solely on the ground 
            that the measure imposes costs on the debtor that cause it to 
            default on the debt. 
 
 
            Article 1111:  Special Formalities and Information Requirements 
 
            1.   Nothing in Article 1102 shall be construed to prevent a 
            Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes 
            special formalities in connection with the establishment of 
            investments by investors of another Party, such as a 
            requirement that investors be residents of the Party or that 
            investments be legally constituted under the laws or 
            regulations of the Party, provided that such formalities do not 
            materially impair the protections afforded by a Party to 
            investors of another Party and investments of investors of 
            another Party pursuant to this Chapter. 
 
            2.   Notwithstanding Articles 1102 or 1103, a Party may require 
            an investor of another Party, or its investment in its 
            territory, to provide routine information concerning that 
            investment solely for informational or statistical purposes.  
            The Party shall protect such business information that is 
            confidential from any disclosure that would prejudice the 
            competitive position of the investor or the investment.  
            Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a Party 
            from otherwise obtaining or disclosing information in 
            connection with the equitable and good faith application of its 
            law. 
 
 
            Article 1112:  Relation to Other Chapters 
 
            1.    In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter 
            and another Chapter, the other Chapter shall prevail to the 
            extent of the inconsistency. 
 
            2.   A requirement by a Party that a service provider of 
            another Party post a bond or other form of financial security 
            as a condition of providing a service into its territory does 
            not of itself make this Chapter applicable to the provision of 
            that cross-border service.  This Chapter applies to that 
            Party's treatment of the posted bond or financial security. 
 
 
            Article 1113:  Denial of Benefits 
 
            1.   A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an 
            investor of another Party that is an enterprise of such Party 
            and to investments of such investor if investors of a non-Party 
            own or control the enterprise and the denying Party: 
 
                 (a)  does not maintain diplomatic relations with the non- 
                      Party; or  
 
                 (b)  adopts or maintains measures with respect to the 
                      non-Party that prohibit transactions with the 
                      enterprise or that would be violated or circumvented 
                      if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the 
                      enterprise or to its investments. 
 
            2.   Subject to prior notification and consultation in 
            accordance with Articles 1803 (Notification and Provision of 
            Information) and 2006 (Consultations), a Party may deny the 
            benefits of this Chapter to an investor of another Party that 
            is an enterprise of such Party and to investments of such 
            investors if investors of a non-Party own or control the 
            enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial business 
            activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is 
            constituted or organized. 
 
 
            Article 1114:  Environmental Measures 
 
            1.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a 
            Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure 
            otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers 
            appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory 
            is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns. 
 
            2.   The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to 
            encourage investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or 
            environmental measures.  Accordingly, a Party should not waive 
            or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise 
            derogate from, such measures as an encouragement for the 
            establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its 
            territory of an investment of an investor.  If a Party 
            considers that another Party has offered such an encouragement, 
            it may request consultations with the other Party and the two 
            Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding any such 
            encouragement. 
 
 
                 Section B - Settlement of Disputes between a Party and 
                              an Investor of Another Party 
 
 
            Article 1115:  Purpose 
 
                 Without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the 
            Parties under Chapter Twenty (Institutional Arrangements and 
            Dispute Settlement Procedures), this Section establishes a 
            mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes that 
            assures both equal treatment among investors of the Parties in 
            accordance with the principle of international reciprocity and 
            due process before an impartial tribunal. 
 
 
            Article 1116:  Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own 
                           Behalf 
 
            1.   An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under 
            this Section a claim that another Party has breached an 
            obligation under: 
 
                 (a)  Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or 
 
                 (b)  Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) 
                      where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent 
                      with the Party's obligations under Section A, 
 
            and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, 
            or arising out of, that breach. 
 
            2.   An investor may not make a claim if more than three years 
            have elapsed from the date on which the investor first 
            acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the 
            alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred 
            loss or damage. 
 
 
            Article 1117:  Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an 
                           Enterprise 
 
            1.   An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of 
            another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns 
            or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration 
            under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached an 
            obligation under: 
 
                 (a)  Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or 
 
                 (b)  Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) 
                      where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent 
                      with the Party's obligations under Section A, 
 
            and that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason 
            of, or arising out of, that breach. 
 
            2.   An investor may not make a claim on behalf of an 
            enterprise described in paragraph 1 if more than three years 
            have elapsed from the date on which the enterprise first 
            acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the 
            alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred 
            loss or damage. 
 
            3.   Where an investor makes a claim under this Article and the 
            investor or a non-controlling investor in the enterprise makes 
            a claim under Article 1116 arising out of the same events that 
            gave rise to the claim under this Article, and two or more of 
            the claims are submitted to arbitration under Article 1120, the 
            claims should be heard together by a Tribunal established under 
            Article 1126, unless the Tribunal finds that the interests of a 
            disputing party would be prejudiced thereby. 
 
            4.   An investment may not make a claim under this Section. 
 
 
            Article 1118:  Settlement of a Claim through Consultation and 
                           Negotiation

            which notice shall specify: 
 
                 (a)  the name and address of the disputing investor and, 
                      where a claim is made under Article 1117, the name

                 (b)  the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been 
                      breached and any other relevant provisions; 
 
                 (c)  the issues and the factual basis for the claim; and 
 
                 (d)  the relief sought and the approximate amount of 
                      damages claimed.

                 (b)  the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, provided that

                      investor, but not both, is a party to the ICSID 
                      Convention; or 
 
                 (c)  the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. 
 
            2.   The applicable arbitration rules shall govern the 
            arbitration except to the extent modified by this Section. 
 
 
            Article 1121:  Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to

                      damage to an interest in an enterprise of another 
                      Party that is a juridical person that the investor 
                      owns or controls directly or indirectly, the 
                      enterprise, waive their right to initiate or continue 
                      before any administrative tribunal or court under the 
                      law of any Party, or other dispute settlement 
                      procedures, any proceedings with respect to the 
                      measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be 
                      a breach referred to in Article 1116, except for 
                      proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other 
                      extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of 
                      damages, before an administrative tribunal or court 
                      under the law of the disputing Party. 
 
            2.   A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1117 
            to arbitration only if both the investor and the enterprise: 
 
                 (a)  consent to arbitration in accordance with the 
                      procedures set out in this Agreement; and

                      proceedings with respect to the measure of the 
                      disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach 
                      referred to in Article 1117, except for proceedings 
                      for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary

                      an administrative tribunal or court under the law of 
                      the disputing Party. 
 
            3.   A consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in 
            writing, shall be delivered to the disputing Party and shall be 
            included in the submission of a claim to arbitration. 
 
            4.   Only where a disputing Party has deprived a disputing 
            investor of control of an enterprise: 
 
                 (a)  a waiver from the enterprise under paragraph 1(b) or

            arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this 
            Agreement. 
 
            2.   The consent given by paragraph 1 and the submission by a 
            disputing investor of a claim to arbitration shall satisfy the 
            requirement of: 
 
                 (a)  Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of

                 Except in respect of a Tribunal established under Article 
            1126, and unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, the 
            Tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator 
            appointed by each of the disputing parties and the third, who 
            shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of 
            the disputing parties.

                           Appoint an Arbitrator or the Disputing Parties 
                           Are Unable to Agree on a Presiding Arbitrator 
 
            1.   The Secretary-General shall serve as appointing authority 
            for an arbitration under this Section. 
 
            2.   If a Tribunal, other than a Tribunal established under 
            Article 1126, has not been constituted within 90 days from the 
            date that a claim is submitted to arbitration, the Secretary- 
            General, on the request of either disputing party, shall 
            appoint, in his discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not 
            yet appointed, except that the presiding arbitrator shall be 
            appointed in accordance with paragraph 3.

            arbitrator from the roster of presiding arbitrators referred to 
            in paragraph 4, provided that the presiding arbitrator shall 
            not be a national of the disputing Party or a national of the 
            Party of the disputing investor.  In the event that no such 
            presiding arbitrator is available to serve, the Secretary- 
            General shall appoint, from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, a 
            presiding arbitrator who is not a national of any of the 
            Parties. 
 
            4.   On the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the 
            Parties shall establish, and thereafter maintain, a roster of 
            45 presiding arbitrators meeting the qualifications of the 
            Convention and rules referred to in Article 1120 and 
            experienced in international law and investment matters.  The 
            roster members shall be appointed by consensus and without 
            regard to nationality. 
 
 
            Article 1125:  Agreement to Appointment of Arbitrators 
 
                 For purposes of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention and 
            Article 7 of Schedule C to the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, 
            and without prejudice to an objection to an arbitrator based on 
            Article 1124(3) or on a ground other than nationality: 
 
                 (a)  the disputing Party agrees to the appointment of each 
                      individual member of a Tribunal established under the 
                      ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility 
                      Rules; 
 
                 (b)  a disputing investor referred to in Article 1116 may 
                      submit a claim to arbitration, or continue a claim, 
                      under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional 
                      Facility Rules, only on condition that the disputing 
                      investor agrees in writing to the appointment of each 
                      individual member of the Tribunal; and 
 
                 (c)  a disputing investor referred to in Article 1117(1) 
                      may submit a claim to arbitration, or continue a 
                      claim, under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID 
                      Additional Facility Rules, only on condition that the 
                      disputing investor and the enterprise agree in 
                      writing to the appointment of each individual member 
                      of the Tribunal. 
 
 
            Article 1126:  Consolidation 
 
            1.   A Tribunal established under this Article shall be 
            established under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and shall 
            conduct its proceedings in accordance with those Rules, except 
            as modified by this Section. 
 
            2.   Where a Tribunal established under this Article is 
            satisfied that claims have been submitted to arbitration under 
            Article 1120 that have a question of law or fact in common, the 
            Tribunal may, in the interests of fair and efficient resolution 
            of the claims, and after hearing the disputing parties, by 
            order: 
 
                 (a)  assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine 
                      together, all or part of the claims; or 
 
                 (b)  assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine one 
                      or more of the claims, the determination of which it 
                      believes would assist in the resolution of the 
                      others. 
 
            3.   A disputing party that seeks an order under paragraph 2 
            shall request the Secretary-General to establish a Tribunal and 
            shall specify in the request: 
 
                 (a)  the name of the disputing Party or disputing 
                      investors against which the order is sought; 
 
                 (b)  the nature of the order sought; and 
 
                 (c)  the grounds on which the order is sought. 
 
            4.   The disputing party shall deliver to the disputing Party 
            or disputing investors against which the order is sought a copy 
            of the request. 
 
            5.   Within 60 days of receipt of the request, the Secretary- 
            General shall establish a Tribunal comprising three 
            arbitrators.  The Secretary-General shall appoint the presiding 
            arbitrator from the roster referred to in Article 1124(4).  In 
            the event that no such presiding arbitrator is available to 
            serve, the Secretary-General shall appoint, from the ICSID 
            Panel of Arbitrators, a presiding arbitrator who is not a 
            national of any of the Parties.  The Secretary-General shall 
            appoint the two other members from the roster referred to in 
            Article 1124(4), and to the extent not available from that 
            roster, from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, and to the extent 
            not available from that Panel, in the discretion of the 
            Secretary-General.  One member shall be a national of the 
            disputing Party and one member shall be a national of a Party 
            of the disputing investors. 
 
            6.   Where a Tribunal has been established under this Article, 
            a disputing investor that has submitted a claim to arbitration 
            under Article 1116 or 1117 and that has not been named in a 
            request made under paragraph 3 may make a written request to 
            the Tribunal that it be included in an order made under 
            paragraph 2, and shall specify in the request: 
 
                 (a)  the name and address of the disputing investor; 
 
                 (b)  the nature of the order sought; and 
 
                 (c)  the grounds on which the order is sought.

            deliver a copy of its request to the disputing parties named in 
            a request made under paragraph 3. 
 
            8.   A Tribunal established under Article 1120 shall not have 
            jurisdiction to decide a claim, or a part of a claim, over 
            which a Tribunal established under this Article has assumed 
            jurisdiction. 
 
            9.   On application of a disputing party, a Tribunal 
            established under this Article, pending its decision under 
            paragraph 2, may order that the proceedings of a Tribunal 
            established under Article 1120 be stayed, unless the latter 
            Tribunal has already adjourned its proceedings. 
 
            10.  A disputing Party shall deliver to the Secretariat, within 
            15 days of receipt by the disputing Party, a copy of: 
 
                 (a)  a request for arbitration made under paragraph (1) of

            appoint one or more experts to report to it in writing on any 
            factual issue concerning environmental, health, safety or other 
            scientific matters raised by a disputing party in a proceeding,

            order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a 
            disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction.  A

                 (a)  monetary damages and any applicable interest;

                      shall provide that the disputing Party may pay 
                      monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu 
                      of restitution, 
 
            A tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the 
            applicable arbitration rules.

                 (c)  the award shall provide that it is made without 
                      prejudice to any right that any person may have in

            except between the disputing parties and in respect of the

            2.   Subject to paragraph 3 and the applicable review procedure 
            for an interim award, a disputing party shall abide by and 
            comply with an award without delay. 
 
            3.   A disputing party may not seek enforcement of a final 
            award until: 
 
                 (a)  in the case of a final award made under the ICSID 
                      Convention 
 
                      (i)  120 days have elapsed from the date the award 
                           was rendered and no disputing party has 
                           requested revision or annulment of the award, or 
 
                      (ii) revision or annulment proceedings have been 
                           completed; and 
 
                 (b)  in the case of a final award under the ICSID 
                      Additional Facility Rules or the UNCITRAL Arbitration 
                      Rules 
 
                       (i)  three months have elapsed from the date the 
                           award was rendered and no disputing party has 
                           commenced a proceeding to revise, set aside or 
                           annul the award, or 
 
                      (ii) a court has dismissed or allowed an application 
                           to revise, set aside or annul the award and

            4.   Each Party shall provide for the enforcement of an award 
            in its territory. 
 
            5.   If a disputing Party fails to abide by or comply with a 
            final award, the Commission, on delivery of a request by a 
            Party whose investor was a party to the arbitration, shall 
            establish a panel under Article 2008 (Request for an Arbitral 
            Panel).  The requesting Party may seek in such proceedings: 
 
                 (a)  a determination that the failure to abide by or 
                      comply with the final award is inconsistent with the 
                      obligations of this Agreement; and 
 
                 (b)  a recommendation that the Party abide by or comply 
                      with the final award. 
 
            6.   A disputing investor may seek enforcement of an 
            arbitration award under the ICSID Convention, the New York 
            Convention or the Inter-American Convention regardless of 
            whether proceedings have been taken under paragraph 5. 
 
            7.   A claim that is submitted to arbitration under this 
            Section shall be considered to arise out of a commercial 
            relationship or transaction for purposes of Article I of the 
            New York Convention and Article I of the Inter-American 
            Convention.

            3.   In an arbitration under this Section, a Party shall not 
            assert, as a defense, counterclaim, right of setoff or 
            otherwise, that the disputing investor has received or will 
            receive, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract,

                      provision of a service; 
 
                 (d)  the presence in its territory of a service provider 
                      of another Party; and 
 
                 (e)  the provision of a bond or other form of financial 
                      security as a condition for the provision of a 
                      service.

                      Fourteen (Financial Services); 
 
                 (b)  air services, including domestic and international 
                      air transportation services, whether scheduled or 
                      non-scheduled, and related services in support of air 
                      services, other than 
 
                      (i)  aircraft repair and maintenance services during 
                           which an aircraft is withdrawn from service, and

                      guarantees and insurance. 
 
            3.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to: 
 
                 (a)  impose any obligation on a Party with respect to a 
                      national of another Party seeking access to its 
                      employment market, or employed on a permanent basis 
                      in its territory, or to confer any right on that 
                      national with respect to that access or employment; 
                      or 
 
                 (b)  prevent a Party from providing a service or 
                      performing a function such as law enforcement, 
                      correctional services, income security or insurance, 
                      social security or insurance, social welfare, public 
                      education, public training, health, and child care, 
                      in a manner that is not inconsistent with this 
                      Chapter.

            1.   Each Party shall accord to service providers of another 
            Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like 
            circumstances, to its own service providers. 
 
            2.   The treatment accorded by a Party under paragraph 1 means, 
            with respect to a state or province, treatment no less 
            favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded, in like 
            circumstances, by that state or province to service providers 
            of the Party of which it forms a part. 
 
 
            Article 1203:  Most-Favored-Nation Treatment 
 
                 Each Party shall accord to service providers of another 
            Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like 
            circumstances, to service providers of any other Party or of a 
            non-Party. 
 
 
            Article 1204:  Standard of Treatment 
 
                 Each Party shall accord to service providers of any other 
            Party the better of the treatment required by Articles 1202 and 
            1203. 
 
 
            Article 1205:  Local Presence 
 
                 No Party may require a service provider of another Party 
            to establish or maintain a representative office or any form of 
            enterprise, or to be resident, in its territory as a condition 
            for the cross-border provision of a service. 
 
 
            Article 1206:  Reservations 
 
            1.   Articles 1202, 1203 and 1205 do not apply to: 
 
                 (a)  any existing non-conforming measure that is 
                      maintained by 
 
                      (i)  a Party at the federal level, as set out in its 
                           Schedule to Annex I, 
 
                      (ii) a state or province, for two years after the 
                           date of entry into force of this Agreement, and 
                           thereafter as set out by a Party in its Schedule 
                           to Annex I in accordance with paragraph 2, or 
 
                      (iii)     a local government; 
 
                 (b)  the continuation or prompt renewal of any non- 
                      conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a); 
                      or  
 
                 (c)  an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred 
                      to in subparagraph (a) to the extent that the 
                      amendment does not decrease the conformity of the 
                      measure, as it existed immediately before the 
                      amendment, with Articles 1202, 1203 and 1205. 
 
            2.   Each Party may set out in its Schedule to Annex I, within 
            two years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, 
            any existing non-conforming measure maintained by a state or 
            province, not including a local government. 
 
            3.   Articles 1202, 1203 and 1205 do not apply to any measure 
            that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to sectors, 
            subsectors or activities, as set out in its Schedule to  
            Annex II. 
 
 
            Article 1207:  Quantitative Restrictions 
 
            1.   Each Party shall set out in its Schedule to Annex V any 
            quantitative restriction that it maintains at the federal 
            level. 
 
            2.   Within one year of the date of entry into force of this 
            Agreement, each Party shall set out in its Schedule to Annex V 
            any quantitative restriction maintained by a state or province, 
            not including a local government. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall notify the other Parties of any 
            quantitative restriction that it adopts, other than at the 
            local government level, after the date of entry into force of 
            this Agreement and shall set out the restriction in its 
            Schedule to Annex V. 
 
            4.   The Parties shall periodically, but in any event at least 
            every two years, endeavor to negotiate the liberalization or 
            removal of the quantitative restrictions set out in Annex V 
            pursuant to paragraphs 1 through 3. 
 
 
            Article 1208:  Liberalization of Non-Discriminatory Measures  
 
                 Each Party shall set out in its Schedule to Annex VI its 
            commitments to liberalize quantitative restrictions, licensing 
            requirements, performance requirements or other non- 
            discriminatory measures. 
 
 
            Article 1209:  Procedures 
 
                 The Commission shall establish procedures for:  
 
                 (a)  a Party to notify and include in its relevant 
                      Schedule 
 
                      (i)  state or provincial measures in accordance with 
                           Article 1206(2), 
 
                      (ii) quantitative restrictions in accordance with 
                           Article 1207(2) and (3), 
 
                      (iii)     commitments pursuant to Article 1208, and  
 
                      (iv) amendments of measures referred to in Article 
                           1206(1)(c); and 
 
                 (b)  consultations on reservations, quantitative 
                      restrictions or commitments with a view to further 
                      liberalization. 
 
 
            Article 1210:  Licensing and Certification 
 
            1.   With a view to ensuring that any measure adopted or 
            maintained by a Party relating to the licensing or 
            certification of nationals of another Party does not constitute 
            an unnecessary barrier to trade, each Party shall endeavor to 
            ensure that any such measure: 
 
                 (a)  is based on objective and transparent criteria, 
                      such as competence and the ability to provide a 
                      service; 
 
                 (b)  is not more burdensome than necessary to ensure 
                      the quality of a service; and 
 
                 (c)  does not constitute a disguised restriction on 
                      the cross-border provision of a service. 
 
            2.   Where a Party recognizes, unilaterally or by agreement, 
            education, experience, licenses or certifications obtained in 
            the territory of another Party or of a non-Party: 
 
                 (a)  nothing in Article 1203 shall be construed to require 
                      the Party to accord such recognition to education, 
                      experience, licenses or certifications obtained in 
                      the territory of another Party; and 
 
                 (b)  the Party shall afford another Party an adequate 
                      opportunity to demonstrate that education, 
                      experience, licenses or certifications obtained in 
                      that other Party's territory should also be 
                      recognized or to conclude an agreement or arrangement 
                      of comparable effect. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall, within two years of the date of entry 
            into force of this Agreement, eliminate any citizenship or 
            permanent residency requirement set out in its Schedule to 
            Annex I that it maintains for the licensing or certification of 
            professional service providers of another Party.  Where a Party 
            does not comply with this obligation with respect to a 
            particular sector, any other Party may, in the same sector and 
            for such period as the non-complying Party maintains its 
            requirement, solely have recourse to maintaining an equivalent 
            requirement set out in its Schedule to Annex I or reinstating: 
 
                 (a)  any such requirement at the federal level that it 
                      eliminated pursuant to this Article; or 
 
                 (b)  on notification to the non-complying Party, any such 
                      requirement at the state or provincial level existing 
                      on the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 
 
            4.   The Parties shall consult periodically with a view to 
            determining the feasibility of removing any remaining 
            citizenship or permanent residency requirement for the 
            licensing or certification of each other's service providers. 
  
            5.   Annex 1210.5 applies to measures adopted or maintained by 
            a Party relating to the licensing or certification of 
            professional service providers. 
 
 
            Article 1211:  Denial of Benefits 
 
            1.   A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to a service 
            provider of another Party where the Party establishes that: 
 
                 (a)  the service is being provided by an enterprise owned 
                      or controlled by nationals of a non-Party, and 
 
                      (i)  the denying Party does not maintain diplomatic 
                           relations with the non-Party, or  
 
                      (ii) the denying Party adopts or maintains measures 
                           with respect to the non-Party that prohibit 
                           transactions with the enterprise or that would 
                           be violated or circumvented if the benefits of 
                           this Chapter were accorded to the enterprise; or 
 
                 (b)  the cross-border provision of a transportation 
                      service covered by this Chapter is provided using 
                      equipment not registered by any Party. 
 
            2.   Subject to prior notification and consultation in 
            accordance with Articles 1803 (Notification and Provision of 
            Information) and 2006 (Consultations), a Party may deny the 
            benefits of this Chapter to a service provider of another Party 
            where the Party establishes that the service is being provided 
            by an enterprise that is owned or controlled by persons of a 
            non-Party and that has no substantial business activities in 
            the territory of any Party. 
 
 
            Article 1212:  Sectoral Annex 
 
                 Annex 1212 applies to specific sectors. 
 
 
            Article 1213:  Definitions 
 
            1.   For purposes of this Chapter, a reference to a federal, 
            state or provincial government includes any non-governmental 
            body in the exercise of any regulatory, administrative or other 
            governmental authority delegated to it by that government.  
 
            2.   For purposes of this Chapter: 
 
            cross-border provision of a service or cross-border trade in 
            services means the provision of a service: 
 
                 (a)  from the territory of a Party into the territory 
                      of another Party, 
 
                 (b)  in the territory of a Party by a person of that 
                      Party to a person of another Party, or 
 
                 (c)  by a national of a Party in the territory of 
                      another Party, 
 
            but does not include the provision of a service in the

                      services reflects economic costs directly related to 
                      providing the services; and  
 
                 (b)  private leased circuits are available on a flat-rate 
                      pricing basis. 
 
            Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent 
            cross-subsidization between public telecommunications transport 
            services. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall ensure that persons of another Party may 
            use public telecommunications transport networks or services 
            for the movement of information in its territory or across its 
            borders, including for intracorporate communications, and for 
            access to information contained in data bases or otherwise 
            stored in machine-readable form in the territory of any Party. 
 
            5.   Further to Article 2101 (General Exceptions), nothing in 
            this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from 
            adopting or enforcing any measure necessary to: 
 
                 (a)  ensure the security and confidentiality of messages; 
                      or 
 
                 (b)  protect the privacy of subscribers to public 
                      telecommunications transport networks or services. 
 
            6.   Each Party shall ensure that no condition is imposed on 
            access to and use of public telecommunications transport 
            networks or services, other than that necessary to: 
 
                 (a)  safeguard the public service responsibilities of 
                      providers of public telecommunications transport 
                      networks or services, in particular their ability to 
                      make their networks or services available to the 
                      public generally; or 
 
                 (b)  protect the technical integrity of public 
                      telecommunications transport networks or services. 
 
            7.   Provided that conditions for access to and use of public 
            telecommunications transport networks or services satisfy the 
            criteria set out in paragraph 6, such conditions may include: 
 
                 (a)  a restriction on resale or shared use of such 
                      services; 
 
                 (b)  a requirement to use specified technical interfaces, 
                      including interface protocols, for interconnection 
                      with such networks or services;  
 
                 (c)  a restriction on interconnection of private leased or 
                      owned circuits with such networks or services or with 
                      circuits leased or owned by another person, where the 
                      circuits are used in the provision of public 
                      telecommunications transport networks or services; 
                      and  
 
                 (d)  a licensing, permit, registration or notification 
                      procedure which, if adopted or maintained, is 
                      transparent and applications filed thereunder are 
                      processed expeditiously. 
 
            8.   For purposes of this Article, "non-discriminatory" means 
            on terms and conditions no less favorable than those accorded 
            to any other customer or user of like public telecommunications 
            transport networks or services in like circumstances. 
 
 
            Article 1303:  Conditions for the Provision of Enhanced or 
                           Value-Added Services  
 
            1.   Each Party shall ensure that: 
 
                 (a)  any licensing, permit, registration or notification 
                      procedure that it adopts or maintains relating to the 
                      provision of enhanced or value-added services is 
                      transparent and non-discriminatory, and that 
                      applications filed thereunder are processed 
                      expeditiously; and 
 
                 (b)  information required under such procedures is limited 
                      to that necessary to demonstrate that the applicant 
                      has the financial solvency to begin providing 
                      services or to assess conformity of the applicant's 
                      terminal or other equipment with the Party's 
                      applicable standards or technical regulations. 
 
            2.   A Party shall not require a person providing enhanced or 
            value-added services to: 
 
                 (a)  provide those services to the public generally;  
 
                 (b)  cost-justify its rates; 
 
                 (c)  file a tariff; 
 
                 (d)  interconnect its networks with any particular 
                      customer or network; or  
 
                 (e)  conform with any particular standard or technical 
                      regulation for interconnection other than for 
                      interconnection to a public telecommunications 
                      transport network. 
 
            3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2(c), a Party may require the 
            filing of a tariff by: 
 
                 (a)  such provider to remedy a practice of that provider 
                      that the Party has found in a particular case to be 
                      anticompetitive under its law; or 
 
                 (b)  a monopoly to which Article 1305 applies. 
 
 
            Article 1304:  Standards-Related Measures  
 
            1.   Further to Article 904(4) (Unnecessary Obstacles), each 
            Party shall ensure that its standards-related measures relating 
            to the attachment of terminal or other equipment to the public 
            telecommunications transport networks, including those measures 
            relating to the use of testing and measuring equipment for 
            conformity assessment procedures, are adopted or maintained 
            only to the extent necessary to: 
 
                 (a)  prevent technical damage to public telecommunications 
                      transport networks;  
 
                 (b)  prevent technical interference with, or degradation 
                      of, public telecommunications transport services;  
 
                 (c)  prevent electromagnetic interference, and ensure 
                      compatibility, with other uses of the electromagnetic 
                      spectrum; 
 
                 (d)  prevent billing equipment malfunction; or 
 
                 (e)  ensure users' safety and access to public 
                      telecommunications transport networks or services. 
 
            2.   A Party may require approval for the attachment to the 
            public telecommunications transport network of terminal or 
            other equipment that is not authorized, provided that the 
            criteria for that approval are consistent with paragraph 1. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall ensure that the network termination 
            points for its public telecommunications transport networks are 
            defined on a reasonable and transparent basis. 
 
            4.   No Party may require separate authorization for equipment 
            that is connected on the customer's side of authorized 
            equipment that serves as a protective device fulfilling the 
            criteria of paragraph 1. 
 
            5.   Further to Article 904(3) (Non-Discriminatory Treatment), 
            each Party shall: 
 
                 (a)  ensure that its conformity assessment procedures are 
                      transparent and non-discriminatory and that 
                      applications filed thereunder are processed 
                      expeditiously; 
 
                 (b)  permit any technically qualified entity to perform 
                      the testing required under the Party's conformity 
                      assessment procedures for terminal or other equipment 
                      to be attached to the public telecommunications 
                      transport network, subject to the Party's right to 
                      review the accuracy and completeness of the test 
                      results; and 
 
                 (c)  ensure that any measure that it adopts or maintains 
                      requiring persons to be authorized to act as agents 
                      for suppliers of telecommunications equipment before 
                      the Party's relevant conformity assessment bodies is 
                      non-discriminatory. 
 
            6.   No later than one year after the date of entry into force 
            of this Agreement, each Party shall adopt, as part of its 
            conformity assessment procedures, provisions necessary to 
            accept the test results from laboratories or testing facilities 
            in the territory of another Party for tests performed in 
            accordance with the accepting Party's standards-related 
            measures and procedures. 
 
            7.   The Telecommunications Standards Subcommittee established 
            under Article 913(5) (Committee on Standards-Related Measures) 
            shall perform the functions set out in Annex 913.5.a-2. 
 
 
            Article 1305:  Monopolies 
 
            1.   Where a Party maintains or designates a monopoly to 
            provide public telecommunications transport networks or 
            services, and the monopoly, directly or through an affiliate, 
            competes in the provision of enhanced or value-added services 
            or other telecommunications-related services or 
            telecommunications-related goods, the Party shall ensure that 
            the monopoly does not use its monopoly position to engage in 
            anticompetitive conduct in those markets, either directly or 
            through its dealings with its affiliates, in such a manner as 
            to affect adversely a person of another Party.  Such conduct 
            may include cross-subsidization, predatory conduct and the 
            discriminatory provision of access to public telecommunications 
            transport networks or services. 
 
            2.   To prevent such anticompetitive conduct, each Party shall 
            adopt or maintain effective measures, such as: 
 
                 (a)  accounting requirements;  
 
                 (b)  requirements for structural separation; 
 
                 (c)  rules to ensure that the monopoly accords its 
                      competitors access to and use of its public 
                      telecommunications transport networks or services on 
                      terms and conditions no less favorable than those it 
                      accords to itself or its affiliates; or  
 
                  (d)  rules to ensure the timely disclosure of technical 
                      changes to public telecommunications transport 
                      networks and their interfaces. 
 
 
            Article 1306:  Transparency 
 
                 Further to Article 1802 (Publication), each Party shall 
            make publicly available its measures relating to access to and 
            use of public telecommunications transport networks or 
            services, including measures relating to: 
 
                 (a)  tariffs and other terms and conditions of service; 
 
                 (b)  specifications of technical interfaces with the 
                      networks or services;  
 
                 (c)  information on bodies responsible for the preparation 
                      and adoption of standards-related measures affecting 
                      such access and use;  
 
                 (d)  conditions applying to attachment of terminal or 
                      other equipment to the networks; and  
 
                 (e)  notification, permit, registration or licensing 
                      requirements. 
 
 
            Article 1307:  Relation to Other Chapters 
 
                 In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and 
            another Chapter, this Chapter shall prevail to the extent of 
            the inconsistency. 
 
 
            Article 1308:  Relation to International Organizations and 
                           Agreements 
 
                 The Parties recognize the importance of international 
            standards for global compatibility and interoperability of 
            telecommunication networks or services and undertake to promote 
            those standards through the work of relevant international 
            bodies, including the International Telecommunication Union and 
            the International Organization for Standardization. 
 
 
            Article 1309:  Technical Cooperation and Other Consultations 
 
            1.   To encourage the development of interoperable 
            telecommunications transport services infrastructure, the 
            Parties shall cooperate in the exchange of technical 
            information, the development of government-to-government 
            training programs and other related activities.  In 
            implementing this obligation, the Parties shall give special 
            emphasis to existing exchange programs. 
 
            2.   The Parties shall consult with a view to determining the 
            feasibility of further liberalizing trade in all 
            telecommunications services, including public 
            telecommunications transport networks and services.

            a Party relating to: 
 
                 (a)  financial institutions of another Party; 
 
                 (b)  investors of another Party, and investments of such 
                      investors, in financial institutions in the Party's 
                      territory; and  
 
                 (c)  cross-border trade in financial services. 
 
            2.   Articles 1109 through 1111, 1113, 1114 and 1211 are hereby 
            incorporated into and made a part of this Chapter.  Articles 
            1115 through 1138 are hereby incorporated into and made a part 
            of this Chapter solely for breaches by a Party of Articles 1109 
            through 1111, 1113 and 1114, as incorporated into this Chapter. 
 
            3.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a 
            Party, including its public entities, from exclusively 
            conducting or providing in its territory: 
 
                 (a)  activities or services forming part of a public 
                      retirement plan or statutory system of social 
                      security; or 
 
                 (b)  activities or services for the account or with the 
                      guarantee or using the financial resources of the 
                      Party, including its public entities. 
 
            4.   Annex 1401.4 applies to the Parties specified in that 
            Annex. 
 
 
            Article 1402:  Self-Regulatory Organizations 
 
                 Where a Party requires a financial institution or a cross- 
            border financial service provider of another Party to be a 
            member of, participate in, or have access to, a self-regulatory 
            organization to provide a financial service in or into the 
            territory of that Party, the Party shall ensure observance of 
            the obligations of this Chapter by such self-regulatory 
            organization. 
 
 
            Article 1403:  Establishment of Financial Institutions 
 
            1.   The Parties recognize the principle that an investor of 
            another Party should be permitted to establish a financial 
            institution in the territory of a Party in the juridical form 
            chosen by such investor. 
 
            2.   The Parties also recognize the principle that an investor 
            of another Party should be permitted to participate widely in a 
            Party's market through the ability of such investor to: 
 
                 (a)  provide in that Party's territory a range of 
                      financial services through separate financial 
                      institutions as may be required by that Party;  
 
                 (b)  expand geographically in that Party's territory; and 
 
                 (c)  own financial institutions in that Party's territory 
                      without being subject to ownership requirements 
                      specific to foreign financial institutions.  
 
            3.   Subject to Annex 1403.3, at such time as the United States 
            permits commercial banks of another Party located in its 
            territory to expand through subsidiaries or direct branches 
            into substantially all of the United States market, the Parties 
            shall review and assess market access provided by each Party in 
            relation to the principles in paragraphs 1 and 2 with a view to 
            adopting arrangements permitting investors of another Party to 
            choose the juridical form of establishment of commercial banks. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall permit an investor of another Party that 
            does not own or control a financial institution in the Party's 
            territory to establish a financial institution in that 
            territory.  A Party may:  
 
                 (a)  require an investor of another Party to incorporate 
                      under the Party's law any financial institution it 
                      establishes in the Party's territory; or 
 
                 (b)  impose terms and conditions on establishment that are 
                      consistent with Article 1405. 
 
            5.   For purposes of this Article, "investor of another Party" 
            means an investor of another Party engaged in the business of 
            providing financial services in the territory of that Party. 
 
 
            Article 1404:  Cross-Border Trade 
 
            1.   No Party may adopt any measure restricting any type of 
            cross-border trade in financial services by cross-border 
            financial service providers of another Party that the Party 
            permits on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, 
            except to the extent set out in Section B of the Party's 
            Schedule to Annex VII. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall permit persons located in its territory, 
            and its nationals wherever located, to purchase financial 
            services from cross-border financial service providers of 
            another Party located in the territory of that other Party or 
            of another Party.  This obligation does not require a Party to 
            permit such providers to do business or solicit in its 
            territory.  Subject to paragraph 1, each Party may define 
            "doing business" and "solicitation" for purposes of this 
            obligation. 
 
            3.   Without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation 
            of cross-border trade in financial services, a Party may 
            require the registration of cross-border financial service 
            providers of another Party and of financial instruments.  
 
            4.   The Parties shall consult on future liberalization of 
            cross-border trade in financial services as set out in Annex 
            1404.4. 
 
 
            Article 1405:  National Treatment 
 
            1.   Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party 
            treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own 
            investors, in like circumstances, with respect to the 
            establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, 
            operation, and sale or other disposition of financial 
            institutions and investments in financial institutions in its 
            territory. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall accord to financial institutions of 
            another Party and to investments of investors of another Party 
            in financial institutions treatment no less favorable than that 
            it accords to its own financial institutions and to investments 
            of its own investors in financial institutions, in like 
            circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, 
            expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other 
            disposition of financial institutions and investments.   
 
            3.   Subject to Article 1404, where a Party permits the cross- 
            border provision of a financial service it shall accord to the 
            cross-border financial service providers of another Party 
            treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own 
            financial service providers, in like circumstances, with 
            respect to the provision of such service.   
 
             4.   The treatment that a Party is required to accord under 
            paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 means, with respect to a measure of any 
            state or province:   
 
                 (a)  in the case of an investor of another Party with an 
                      investment in a financial institution, an investment 
                      of such investor in a financial institution, or a 
                      financial institution of such investor, located in a 
                      state or province, treatment no less favorable than 
                      the treatment accorded to an investor of the Party in 
                      a financial institution, an investment of such 
                      investor in a financial institution, or a financial 
                      institution of such investor, located in that state 
                      or province, in like circumstances; and  
 
                 (b)  in any other case, treatment no less favorable than 
                      the most favorable treatment accorded to an investor 
                      of the Party in a financial institution, its 
                      financial institution or its investment in a 
                      financial institution, in like circumstances.   
 
            For greater certainty, in the case of an investor of another 
            Party with investments in financial institutions or financial 
            institutions of such investor, located in more than one state 
            or province, the treatment required under subparagraph (a) 
            means: 
 
                 (c)  treatment of the investor that is no less favorable 
                      than the most favorable treatment accorded to an 
                      investor of the Party with an investment located in 
                      such states, in like circumstances; and  
 
                 (d)  with respect to an investment of the investor in a 
                      financial institution or a financial institution of 
                      such investor, located in a state or province, 
                      treatment no less favorable than that accorded to an 
                      investment of an investor of the Party, or a 
                      financial institution of such investor, located in 
                      that state or province, in like circumstances.   
 
            5.   A Party's treatment of financial institutions and cross- 
            border financial service providers of another Party, whether 
            different or identical to that accorded to its own institutions 
            or providers in like circumstances, is consistent with 
            paragraphs 1 through 3 if the treatment affords equal 
            competitive opportunities. 
 
            6.   A Party's treatment affords equal competitive 
            opportunities if it does not disadvantage financial 
            institutions and cross-border financial services providers of 
            another Party in their ability to provide financial services as 
            compared with the ability of the Party's own financial 
            institutions and financial services providers to provide such 
            services, in like circumstances. 
 
            7.   Differences in market share, profitability or size do not 
            in themselves establish a denial of equal competitive 
            opportunities, but such differences may be used as evidence 
            regarding whether a Party's treatment affords equal competitive 
            opportunities. 
 
 
            Article 1406:  Most-Favored-Nation Treatment 
 
            1.   Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, 
            financial institutions of another Party, investments of 
            investors in financial institutions and cross-border financial 
            service providers of another Party treatment no less favorable 
            than that it accords to the investors, financial institutions, 
            investments of investors in financial institutions and cross- 
            border financial service providers of any other Party or of a 
            non-Party, in like circumstances. 
 
            2.   A Party may recognize prudential measures of another Party 
            or of a non-Party in the application of measures covered by 
            this Chapter.  Such recognition may be: 
 
                 (a)  accorded unilaterally; 
 
                 (b)  achieved through harmonization or other means; or 
 
                 (c)  based upon an agreement or arrangement with the other 
                      Party or non-Party. 
 
            3.   A Party according recognition of prudential measures under 
            paragraph 2 shall provide adequate opportunity to another Party 
            to demonstrate that circumstances exist in which there are or 
            would be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of 
            regulation, and if appropriate, procedures concerning the 
            sharing of information between the Parties. 
 
            4.   Where a Party accords recognition of prudential measures 
            under paragraph 2(c) and the circumstances set out in paragraph 
            3 exist, the Party shall provide adequate opportunity to 
            another Party to negotiate accession to the agreement or 
            arrangement, or to negotiate a comparable agreement or 
            arrangement. 
 
 
            Article 1407:  New Financial Services and Data Processing  
 
  
            1.   Each Party shall permit a financial institution of another 
            Party to provide any new financial service of a type similar to 
            those services that the Party permits its own financial 
            institutions, in like circumstances, to provide under its 
            domestic law.  A Party may determine the institutional and 
            juridical form through which the service may be provided and 
            may require authorization for the provision of the service.  
            Where such authorization is required, a decision shall be made 
            within a reasonable time and the authorization may only be 
            refused for prudential reasons.  
 
            2.   Each Party shall permit a financial institution of another 
            Party to transfer information in electronic or other form, into 
            and out of the Party's territory, for data processing where 
            such processing is required in the ordinary course of business 
            of such institution. 
 
 
            Article 1408:  Senior Management and Boards of Directors 
 
            1.   No Party may require financial institutions of another 
            Party to engage individuals of any particular nationality as 
            senior managerial or other essential personnel. 
 
            2.   No Party may require that more than a simple majority of 
            the board of directors of a financial institution of another 
            Party be composed of nationals of the Party, persons residing 
            in the territory of the Party, or a combination thereof. 
 
 
            Article 1409:  Reservations and Specific Commitments 
 
            1.   Articles 1403 through 1408 do not apply to: 
 
                 (a)  any existing non-conforming measure that is 
                      maintained by 
 
                      (i)  a Party at the federal level, as set out in 
                           Section A of its Schedule to Annex VII, 
 
                      (ii) a state or province, for the period ending on 
                           the date specified in Annex 1409.1 for that 
                           state or province, and thereafter as described 
                           by the Party in Section A of its Schedule to 
                           Annex VII in accordance with Annex 1409.1, or 
 
                      (iii)     a local government; 
 
                 (b)  the continuation or prompt renewal of any non- 
                      conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a); 
                      or 
 
                 (c)  an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred 
                      to in subparagraph (a) to the extent that the 
                      amendment does not decrease the conformity of the 
                      measure, as it existed immediately before the 
                      amendment, with Articles 1403 through 1408. 
 
            2.   Articles 1403 through 1408 do not apply to any non- 
            conforming measure that a Party adopts or maintains in 
            accordance with Section B of its Schedule to Annex VII. 
 
            3.   Section C of each Party's Schedule to Annex VII sets out 
            certain specific commitments by that Party. 
 
            4.   Where a Party has set out a reservation to Article 1102, 
            1103, 1202 or 1203 in its Schedule to Annex I, II, III or IV, 
            the reservation shall be deemed to constitute a reservation to 
            Article 1405 or 1406, as the case may be, to the extent that 
            the measure, sector, subsector or activity set out in the 
            reservation is covered by this Chapter. 
 
 
            Article 1410:  Exceptions 
 
            1.   Nothing in this Part shall be construed to prevent a Party 
            from adopting or maintaining reasonable measures for prudential 
            reasons, such as: 
 
                 (a)  the protection of investors, depositors, financial 
                      market participants, policy-holders, policy- 
                      claimants, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is 
                      owed by a financial institution or cross-border 
                      financial service provider; 
 
                 (b)  the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity 
                      or financial responsibility of financial institutions 
                      or cross-border financial service providers; and 
 
                 (c)  ensuring the integrity and stability of a Party's 
                      financial system. 
 
            2.   Nothing in this Part applies to non-discriminatory 
            measures of general application taken by any public entity in 
            pursuit of monetary and related credit policies or exchange 
            rate policies.  This paragraph shall not affect a Party's 
            obligations under Article 1106 (Investment - Performance 
            Requirements) with respect to measures covered by Chapter 
            Eleven (Investment) or Article 1109 (Investments - Transfers). 
 
            3.   Article 1405 shall not apply to the granting by a Party to 
            a financial institution of an exclusive right to provide a 
            financial service referred to in Article 1401(3)(a). 
 
            4.   Notwithstanding Article 1109(1), (2) and (3), as 
            incorporated into this Chapter, and without limiting the 
            applicability of Article 1109(4), as incorporated into this 
            Chapter, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial 
            institution or cross-border financial services provider to, or 
            for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to such 
            institution or provider, through the equitable, non- 
            discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating 
            to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial 
            responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border 
            financial service providers.  This paragraph does not prejudice 
            any other provision of this Agreement that permits a Party to 
            restrict transfers. 
 
            Article 1411:  Transparency 
 
            1.   In lieu of Article 1802(2) (Publication), each Party 
            shall, to the extent practicable, provide in advance to all 
            interested persons any measure of general application that the 
            Party proposes to adopt in order to allow an opportunity for 
            such persons to comment on the measure.  Such measure shall be 
            provided: 
 
                 (a)  by means of official publication; 
 
                 (b)  in other written form; or 
 
                 (c)  in such other form as permits an interested person to

                      providers; or  
 
                 (b)  any confidential information, the disclosure of which 
                      would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary 
                      to the public interest or prejudice legitimate 
                      commercial interests of particular enterprises.   
 
            6.   Each Party shall maintain or establish one or more inquiry 
            points no later than 180 days after the date of entry into 
            force of this Agreement, to respond in writing as soon as 
            practicable, to all reasonable inquiries from interested

            regulatory authorities participating in consultations under 
            paragraph 3 to disclose information or take any action that 
            would interfere with individual regulatory, supervisory,

            the Commission.  The decision shall be binding on the Tribunal.

            consultations shall be completed expeditiously.    
 
            2.   In considering the potential adverse effects, the Parties 
            shall take into account:   
 
                 (a)  the threat that the Mexican payments system may be 
                      controlled by non-Mexican persons;  
 
                 (b)  the effects foreign commercial banks established in 
                      Mexico may have on Mexico's ability to conduct 
                      monetary and exchange-rate policy effectively; and  
 
                 (c)  the adequacy of this Chapter in protecting the 
                      Mexican payments system. 
 
            3.   If no consensus is reached on the matters referred to in 
            paragraph 1, any Party may request the establishment of an 
            arbitral panel under Article 1414 or Article 2008 (Request for 
            an Arbitral Panel).  The panel proceedings shall be conducted 
            in accordance with the Model Rules of Procedure established 
            under Article 2012 (Rules of Procedure).  The Panel shall 
            present its determination within 60 days after the last 
            panelist is selected or such other period as the Parties to the 
            proceeding may agree.  Article 2018 (Implementation of Final 
            Report) and 2019 (Non-Implementation -- Suspension of Benefits) 
 
                              Annex 1413.6                                  
 
            shall not apply in such proceedings.

            anti-competitive business conduct and take appropriate action 
            with respect thereto, recognizing that such measures will 
            enhance the fulfillment of the objectives of this Agreement.  
            To this end the Parties shall consult from time to time about 
            the effectiveness of measures undertaken by each Party. 
 
            2.   Each Party recognizes the importance of cooperation and 
            coordination among their authorities to further effective 
            competition law enforcement in the free trade area.  The 
            Parties shall cooperate on issues of competition law 
            enforcement policy, including mutual legal assistance, 
            notification, consultation and exchange of information relating 
            to the enforcement of competition laws and policies in the free 
            trade area. 
 
            3.   No Party may have recourse to dispute settlement under

            designation may affect the interests of persons of another 
            Party, the Party shall: 
 
                 (a)  wherever possible, provide prior written notification 
                      to the other Party of the designation; and 
 
                 (b)  endeavor to introduce at the time of the designation 
                      such conditions on the operation of the monopoly as 
                      will minimize or eliminate any nullification or 
                      impairment of benefits in the sense of Annex 2004 
                      (Nullification and Impairment). 
 
            3.   Each Party shall ensure, through regulatory control, 
            administrative supervision or the application of other 
            measures, that any privately-owned monopoly that it designates 
            and any government monopoly that it maintains or designates: 
 
                 (a)  acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the 
                      Party's obligations under this Agreement wherever 
                      such a monopoly exercises any regulatory, 
                      administrative or other governmental authority that 
                      the Party has delegated to it in connection with the 
                      monopoly good or service, such as the power to grant 
                      import or export licenses, approve commercial 
                      transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges; 
 
                 (b)  except to comply with any terms of its designation 
                      that are not inconsistent with subparagraph (c) or 
                      (d), acts solely in accordance with commercial 
                      considerations in its purchase or sale of the 
                      monopoly good or service in the relevant market, 
                      including with regard to price, quality, 
                      availability, marketability, transportation and other 
                      terms and conditions of purchase or sale; 
 
                 (c)  provides non-discriminatory treatment to investments 
                      of investors, to goods and to service providers of 
                      another Party in its purchase or sale of the monopoly 
                      good or service in the relevant market; and 
 
                 (d)  does not use its monopoly position to engage, either 
                      directly or indirectly, including through its 
                      dealings with its parent, its subsidiary or other 
                      enterprise with common ownership, in anticompetitive 
                      practices in a non-monopolized market in its 
                      territory that adversely affect an investment of an 
                      investor of another Party, including through the 
                      discriminatory provision of the monopoly good or 
                      service, cross-subsidization or predatory conduct. 
 
            4.   Paragraph 3 does not apply to procurement by governmental 
            agencies of goods or services for governmental purposes and not 
            with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the

            Party from maintaining or establishing a state enterprise. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall ensure, through regulatory control, 
            administrative supervision or the application of other 
            measures, that any state enterprise that it maintains or 
            establishes acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the 
            Party's obligations under Chapters Eleven (Investment) and 
            Fourteen (Financial Services) wherever such enterprise 
            exercises any regulatory, administrative or other governmental 
            authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power 
            to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions 
            or impose quotas, fees or other charges. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall ensure that any state enterprise that it 
            maintains or establishes accords non-discriminatory treatment

            Party's territory of investors of another Party. 
 
 
            Article 1504:  Working Group on Trade and Competition 
 
                 The Commission shall establish a Working Group on Trade

            Article 1601:   General Principles 
 
                 Further to Article 102 (Objectives), this Chapter reflects 
            the preferential trading relationship between the Parties, the 
            desirability of facilitating temporary entry on a reciprocal 
            basis and of establishing transparent criteria and procedures 
            for temporary entry, and the need to ensure border security and 
            to protect the domestic labor force and permanent employment in 
            their respective territories. 
 
 
            Article 1602:   General Obligations

            to avoid unduly impairing or delaying trade in goods or 
            services or conduct of investment activities under this 
            Agreement. 
 
            2.   The Parties shall endeavor to develop and adopt common 
            criteria, definitions and interpretations for the 
            implementation of this Chapter. 
 
 
            Article 1603:   Grant of Temporary Entry  
 
            1.   Each Party shall grant temporary entry to business persons 
            who are otherwise qualified for entry under applicable measures 
            relating to public health and safety and national security, in 
            accordance with this Chapter, including the provisions of Annex 
            1603. 
 
            2.   A Party may refuse to issue an immigration document 
            authorizing employment to a business person where the temporary 
            entry of that person might affect adversely: 
 
                 (a)  the settlement of any labor dispute that is in 
                      progress at the place or intended place of

                      dispute. 
 
            3.   When a Party refuses pursuant to paragraph 2 to issue an 
            immigration document authorizing employment, it shall: 
 
                 (a)  inform in writing the business person of the reasons 
                      for the refusal; and  
 
                 (b)  promptly notify in writing the Party whose business 
                      person has been refused entry of the reasons for the 
                      refusal. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall limit any fees for processing 
            applications for temporary entry of business persons to the 
            approximate cost of services rendered. 
 
 
            Article 1604:   Provision of Information

                      enable them to become acquainted with its measures 
                      relating to this Chapter; and 
 
                 (b)  no later than one year after the date of entry into 
                      force of this Agreement, prepare, publish and make

                      territories of the other Parties, explanatory 
                      material in a consolidated document regarding the 
                      requirements for temporary entry under this Chapter 
                      in such a manner as will enable business persons of 
                      the other Parties to become acquainted with them. 
 
            2.   Subject to Annex 1604.2, each Party shall collect and 
            maintain, and make available to the other Parties in accordance 
            with its domestic law, data respecting the granting of 
            temporary entry under this Chapter to business persons of the 
            other Parties who have been issued immigration documentation, 
            including data specific to each occupation, profession or 
            activity.   
 
 
            Article 1605:   Working Group 
 
            1.   The Parties hereby establish a Temporary Entry Working

                      Chapter;  
 
                 (b)  the development of measures to further facilitate 
                      temporary entry of business persons on a reciprocal 
                      basis;  
 
                 (c)  the waiving of labor certification tests or 
                      procedures of similar effect for spouses of business 
                      persons who have been granted temporary entry for 
                      more than one year under Section B, C or D of Annex 
                      1603; and 
 
                 (d)  proposed modifications of or additions to this 
                      Chapter. 
 
 
            Article 1606:   Dispute Settlement 
 
            1.   A Party may not initiate proceedings under Article 2007 
            (Commission - Good Offices, Conciliation and Mediation) 
            regarding a refusal to grant temporary entry under this Chapter 
            or a particular case arising under Article 1602(1) unless: 
 
                 (a)  the matter involves a pattern of practice; and 
 
                 (b)  the business person has exhausted the available 
                      administrative remedies regarding the particular 
                      matter. 
 
            2.   The remedies referred to in paragraph (1)(b) shall be 
            deemed to be exhausted if a final determination in the matter 
            has not been issued by the competent authority within one year 
            of the institution of an administrative proceeding, and the 
            failure to issue a determination is not attributable to delay 
            caused by the business person.

            1.   Each Party shall grant temporary entry to a business 
            person seeking to engage in a business activity set out in 
            Appendix 1603.A.1, without requiring that person to obtain an 
            employment authorization, provided that the business person 
            otherwise complies with existing immigration measures 
            applicable to temporary entry, on presentation of: 
 
                 (a)  proof of citizenship of a Party;

                 (c)  evidence demonstrating that the proposed business 
                      activity is international in scope and that the 
                      business person is not seeking to enter the local 
                      labor market. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide that a business person may 
            satisfy the requirements of paragraph 1(c) by demonstrating 
            that: 
 
                 (a)  the primary source of remuneration for the proposed 
                      business activity is outside the territory of the 
                      Party granting temporary entry; and 
 
                 (b)  the business person's principal place of business and 
                      the actual place of accrual of profits, at least

            A Party shall normally accept an oral declaration as to the 
            principal place of business and the actual place of accrual of 
            profits.  Where the Party requires further proof, it shall 
            normally consider a letter from the employer attesting to these 
            matters as sufficient proof. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall grant temporary entry to a business 
            person seeking to engage in a business activity other than 
            those set out in Appendix 1603.A.1, without requiring that 
            person to obtain an employment authorization, on a basis no 
            less favorable than that provided under the existing provisions 
 
                       Annex 1603 
 
            of the measures set out in Appendix 1603.A.3, provided that the 
            business person otherwise complies with existing immigration 
            measures applicable to temporary entry.

                      similar effect; or 
 
                 (b)  impose or maintain any numerical restriction relating 
                      to temporary entry under paragraph 1 or 3.

            business person seeking temporary entry under this Section to 
            obtain a visa or its equivalent prior to entry.  Before 
            imposing a visa requirement, the Party shall consult, on 
            request, with a Party whose business persons would be affected 
            with a view to avoiding the imposition of the requirement.  
            With respect to an existing visa requirement, a Party shall 
            consult, on request, with a Party whose business persons are 
            subject to the requirement with a view to its removal.

            avoiding the imposition of the requirement.  With respect to an 
            existing visa requirement, a Party shall consult, on request,

                      Parties.

            a Party's applicable immigration measures relating to the entry

            pursuant to paragraph 4, it shall consult with the other Party 
            concerned with a view to determining a date after which the 
            limit shall cease to apply.

                                        PART SIX 
                                 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
                                   Chapter Seventeen  
 
                                 Intellectual Property 
 
 
            Article 1701:   Nature and Scope of Obligations 
 
            1.   Each Party shall provide in its territory to the nationals 
            of another Party adequate and effective protection and 
            enforcement of intellectual property rights, while ensuring 
            that measures to enforce intellectual property rights do not 
            themselves become barriers to legitimate trade. 
 
            2.   To provide adequate and effective protection and 
            enforcement of intellectual property rights, each Party shall, 
            at a minimum, give effect to this Chapter and to the 
            substantive provisions of: 
 
                 (a)  the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Producers 
                      of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of 
                      their Phonograms, 1971 (Geneva Convention); 
 
                 (b)  the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary 
                      and Artistic Works, 1971 (Berne Convention); 
 
                 (c)  the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial 
                      Property, 1967 (Paris Convention); and 
 
                 (d)  the International Convention for the Protection of 
                      New Varieties of Plants, 1978 (UPOV Convention), or 
                      the International Convention for the Protection of 
                      New Varieties of Plants, 1991 (UPOV Convention). 
 
            If a Party has not acceded to the specified text of any such 
            Conventions on or before the date of entry into force of this 
            Agreement, it shall make every effort to accede. 
 
            3.   Annex 1701.3 applies to the Parties specified in that 
            Annex. 
 
 
            Article 1702:   More Extensive Protection 
 
                 A Party may implement in its domestic law more extensive 
            protection of intellectual property rights than is required 
            under this Agreement, provided that such protection is not 
            inconsistent with this Agreement. 
 
            Article 1703:   National Treatment 
 
            1.   Each Party shall accord to nationals of another Party 
            treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own 
            nationals with regard to the protection and enforcement of all 
            intellectual property rights.  In respect of sound recordings, 
            each Party shall provide such treatment to producers and 
            performers of another Party, except that a Party may limit 
            rights of performers of another Party in respect of secondary 
            uses of sound recordings to those rights its nationals are 
            accorded in the territory of such other Party. 
 
            2.   No Party may, as a condition of according national 
            treatment under this Article, require right holders to comply 
            with any formalities or conditions in order to acquire rights 
            in respect of copyright and related rights. 
 
            3.   A Party may derogate from paragraph 1 in relation to its 
            judicial and administrative procedures for the protection or 
            enforcement of intellectual property rights, including any 
            procedure requiring a national of another Party to designate 
            for service of process an address in the Party's territory or 
            to appoint an agent in the Party's territory, if the derogation 
            is consistent with the relevant Convention listed in Article 
            1701(2), provided that such derogation: 
 
                 (a)  is necessary to secure compliance with measures that 
                      are not inconsistent with this Chapter; and 
 
                 (b)  is not applied in a manner that would constitute a 
                      disguised restriction on trade. 
 
            4.   No Party shall have any obligation under this Article with 
            respect to procedures provided in multilateral agreements 
            concluded under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property 
            Organization relating to the acquisition or maintenance of 
            intellectual property rights. 
 
 
            Article 1704:   Control of Abusive or Anticompetitive 
                            Practices or Conditions 
 
                 Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from 
            specifying in its domestic law licensing practices or 
            conditions that may in particular cases constitute an abuse of 
            intellectual property rights having an adverse effect on 
            competition in the relevant market.  A Party may adopt or 
            maintain, consistent with the other provisions of this 
            Agreement, appropriate measures to prevent or control such 
            practices or conditions. 
 
            Article 1705:   Copyright 
 
            1.   Each Party shall protect the works covered by Article 2 of 
            the Berne Convention, including any other works that embody 
            original expression within the meaning of that Convention.  In 
            particular:  
 
                 (a)  all types of computer programs are literary works 
                      within the meaning of the Berne Convention and each 
                      Party shall protect them as such; and 
 
                 (b)  compilations of data or other material, whether in 
                      machine readable or other form, which by reason of 
                      the selection or arrangement of their contents 
                      constitute intellectual creations, shall be protected 
                      as such. 
 
            The protection a Party provides under subparagraph (b) shall 
            not extend to the data or material itself, or prejudice any 
            copyright subsisting in that data or material. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide to authors and their successors 
            in interest those rights enumerated in the Berne Convention in 
            respect of works covered by paragraph 1, including the right to 
            authorize or prohibit: 
 
                 (a)  the importation into the Party's territory of copies 
                      of the work made without the right holder's 
                      authorization; 
 
                 (b)  the first public distribution of the original and 
                      each copy of the work by sale, rental or otherwise; 
 
                 (c)  the communication of a work to the public; and 
 
                 (d)  the commercial rental of the original or a copy of a 
                      computer program. 
 
            Subparagraph (d) shall not apply where the copy of the computer 
            program is not itself an essential object of the rental.  Each 
            Party shall provide that putting the original or a copy of a 
            computer program on the market with the right holder's consent 
            shall not exhaust the rental right. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related 
            rights: 
 
                 (a)  any person acquiring or holding economic rights may 
                      freely and separately transfer such rights by 
                      contract for purposes of their exploitation and 
                      enjoyment by the transferee; and 
 
                 (b)  any person acquiring or holding such economic rights 
                      by virtue of a contract, including contracts of 
                      employment underlying the creation of works and sound 
                      recordings, shall be able to exercise those rights in 
                      its own name and enjoy fully the benefits derived 
                      from those rights. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall provide that, where the term of 
            protection of a work, other than a photographic work or a work 
            of applied art, is to be calculated on a basis other than the 
            life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than 50 
            years from the end of the calendar year of the first authorized 
            publication of the work or, failing such authorized publication 
            within 50 years from the making of the work, 50 years from the 
            end of the calendar year of making. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to the 
            rights provided for in this Article to certain special cases 
            that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and 
            do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the 
            right holder. 
 
            6.   No Party may grant translation and reproduction licenses 
            permitted under the Appendix to the Berne Convention where 
            legitimate needs in that Party's territory for copies or 
            translations of the work could be met by the right holder's 
            voluntary actions but for obstacles created by the Party's 
            measures.  
 
            7.   Annex 1705.7 applies to the Parties specified in that 
            Annex. 
 
 
            Article 1706:   Sound Recordings 
 
            1.   Each Party shall provide to the producer of a sound 
            recording the right to authorize or prohibit: 
 
                 (a)  the direct or indirect reproduction of the sound 
                      recording; 
 
                 (b)  the importation into the Party's territory of copies 
                      of the sound recording made without the producer's 
                      authorization; 
 
                 (c)  the first public distribution of the original and 
                      each copy of the sound recording by sale, rental or 
                      otherwise; and 
 
                 (d)  the commercial rental of the original or a copy of 
                      the sound recording, except where expressly otherwise 
                      provided in a contract between the producer of the 
                      sound recording and the authors of the works fixed 
                      therein. 
 
            Each Party shall provide that putting the original or a copy of 
            a sound recording on the market with the right holder's consent 
            shall not exhaust the rental right. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide a term of protection for sound 
            recordings of at least 50 years from the end of the calendar 
            year in which the fixation was made. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to the 
            rights provided for in this Article to certain special cases 
            that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the sound 
            recording and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate 
            interests of the right holder. 
 
 
            Article 1707:   Protection of Encrypted Program-Carrying 
                            Satellite Signals 
 
                 Within one year from the date of entry into force of this 
            Agreement, each Party shall make it: 
 
                 (a)  a criminal offense to manufacture, import, sell, 
                      lease or otherwise make available a device or system 
                      that is primarily of assistance in decoding an 
                      encrypted program-carrying satellite signal without 
                      the authorization of the lawful distributor of such 
                      signal; and 
 
                 (b)  a civil offense to receive, in connection with 
                      commercial activities, or further distribute, an 
                      encrypted program-carrying satellite signal that has 
                      been decoded without the authorization of the lawful 
                      distributor of the signal or to engage in any 
                      activity prohibited under subparagraph (a). 
 
            Each Party shall provide that any civil offense established 
            under subparagraph (b) shall be actionable by any person that 
            holds an interest in the content of such signal. 
 
 
            Article 1708:   Trademarks 
 
            1.   For purposes of this Agreement, a trademark consists of 
            any sign, or any combination of signs, capable of 
            distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those 
            of another, including personal names, designs, letters, 
            numerals, colors, figurative elements, or the shape of goods or 
            of their packaging.  Trademarks shall include service marks and 
            collective marks, and may include certification marks.  A Party 
            may require, as a condition for registration, that a sign be 
            visually perceptible. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide to the owner of a registered 
            trademark the right to prevent all persons not having the 
            owner's consent from using in commerce identical or similar 
            signs for goods or services that are identical or similar to 
            those goods or services in respect of which the owner's 
            trademark is registered, where such use would result in a 
            likelihood of confusion.  In the case of the use of an 
            identical sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of 
            confusion shall be presumed.  The rights described above shall 
            not prejudice any prior rights, nor shall they affect the 
            possibility of a Party making rights available on the basis of 
            use. 
 
            3.   A Party may make registrability depend on use.  However, 
            actual use of a trademark shall not be a condition for filing 
            an application for registration.  No Party may refuse an 
            application solely on the ground that intended use has not 
            taken place before the expiry of a period of three years from 
            the date of application for registration. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall provide a system for the registration of 
            trademarks, which shall include: 
 
                 (a)  examination of applications; 
 
                 (b)  notice to be given to an applicant of the reasons for 
                      the refusal to register a trademark; 
 
                 (c)  a reasonable opportunity for the applicant to respond 
                      to the notice; 
 
                 (d)  publication of each trademark either before or 
                      promptly after it is registered; and 
 
                 (e)  a reasonable opportunity for interested persons to 
                      petition to cancel the registration of a trademark. 
 
            A Party may provide for a reasonable opportunity for interested 
            persons to oppose the registration of a trademark. 
 
            5.   The nature of the goods or services to which a trademark 
            is to be applied shall in no case form an obstacle to the 
            registration of the trademark. 
 
            6.   Article 6bis of the Paris Convention shall apply, with 
            such modifications as may be necessary, to services.  In 
            determining whether a trademark is well-known, account shall be 
            taken of the knowledge of the trademark in the relevant sector 
            of the public, including knowledge in the Party's territory 
            obtained as a result of the promotion of the trademark.  No 
            Party may require that the reputation of the trademark extend 
            beyond the sector of the public that normally deals with the 
            relevant goods or services. 
 
            7.   Each Party shall provide that the initial registration of 
            a trademark be for a term of at least 10 years and that the 
            registration be indefinitely renewable for terms of not less 
            than 10 years when conditions for renewal have been met. 
 
            8.   Each Party shall require the use of a trademark to 
            maintain a registration.  The registration may be canceled for 
            the reason of non-use only after an uninterrupted period of at 
            least two years of non-use, unless valid reasons based on the 
            existence of obstacles to such use are shown by the trademark 
            owner.  Each Party shall recognize, as valid reasons for non- 
            use, circumstances arising independently of the will of the 
            trademark owner that constitute an obstacle to the use of the 
            trademark, such as import restrictions on, or other government 
            requirements for, goods or services identified by the 
            trademark. 
 
            9.   Each Party shall recognize use of a trademark by a person 
            other than the trademark owner, where such use is subject to 
            the owner's control, as use of the trademark for purposes of 
            maintaining the registration. 
 
            10.  No Party may encumber the use of a trademark in commerce 
            by special requirements, such as a use that reduces the 
            trademark's function as an indication of source or a use with 
            another trademark. 
 
            11.  A Party may determine conditions on the licensing and 
            assignment of trademarks, it being understood that the 
            compulsory licensing of trademarks shall not be permitted and 
            that the owner of a registered trademark shall have the right 
            to assign its trademark with or without the transfer of the 
            business to which the trademark belongs. 
 
            12.  A Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights 
            conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive 
            terms, provided that such exceptions take into account the 
            legitimate interests of the trademark owner and of other 
            persons. 
 
            13.  Each Party shall prohibit the registration as a trademark 
            of words, at least in English, French or Spanish, that 
            generically designate goods or services or types of goods or 
            services to which the trademark applies. 
 
            14.  Each Party shall refuse to register trademarks that 
            consist of or comprise immoral, deceptive or scandalous matter, 
            or matter that may disparage or falsely suggest a connection 
            with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs or any 
            Party's national symbols, or bring them into contempt or 
            disrepute. 
 
 
            Article 1709:   Patents 
 
            1.   Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, each Party shall make 
            patents available for any inventions, whether products or 
            processes, in all fields of technology, provided that such 
            inventions are new, result from an inventive step and are 
            capable of industrial application.  For purposes of this 
            Article, a Party may deem the terms "inventive step" and 
            "capable of industrial application" to be synonymous with the 
            terms "non-obvious" and "useful", respectively. 
 
            2.   A Party may exclude from patentability inventions if 
            preventing in its territory the commercial exploitation of the 
            inventions is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, 
            including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or 
            to avoid serious prejudice to nature or the environment, 
            provided that the exclusion is not based solely on the ground 
            that the Party prohibits commercial exploitation in its 
            territory of the subject matter of the patent. 
 
            3.   A Party may also exclude from patentability: 
 
                 (a)  diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the 
                      treatment of humans or animals; 
 
                 (b)  plants and animals other than microorganisms; and 
 
                 (c)  essentially biological processes for the production 
                      of plants or animals, other than non-biological and 
                      microbiological processes for such production. 
 
            Notwithstanding subparagraph (b), each Party shall provide for 
            the protection of plant varieties through patents, an effective 
            scheme of sui generis protection, or both. 
 
            4.   If a Party has not made available product patent 
            protection for pharmaceutical or agricultural chemicals 
            commensurate with paragraph 1: 
 
                 (a)  as of January 1, 1992, for subject matter that 
                      relates to naturally occurring substances prepared or 
                      produced by, or significantly derived from, 
                      microbiological processes and intended for food or 
                      medicine, and 
 
                 (b)  as of July 1, 1991, for any other subject matter, 
 
            that Party shall provide to the inventor of any such product or 
            its assignee the means to obtain product patent protection for 
            such product for the unexpired term of the patent for such 
            product granted in another Party, as long as the product has 
            not been marketed in the Party providing protection under this 
            paragraph and the person seeking such protection makes a timely 
            request. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall provide that: 
 
                 (a)  where the subject matter of a patent is a product, 
                      the patent shall confer on the patent owner the right 
                      to prevent other persons from making, using or 
                      selling the subject matter of the patent, without the 
                      patent owner's consent; and  
 
                 (b)  where the subject matter of a patent is a process, 
                      the patent shall confer on the patent owner the right 
                      to prevent other persons from using that process and 
                      from using, selling, or importing at least the 
                      product obtained directly by that process, without 
                      the patent owner's consent. 
 
            6.   A Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive 
            rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do 
            not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the 
            patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate 
            interests of the patent owner, taking into account the 
            legitimate interests of other persons. 
 
            7.   Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, patents shall be available 
            and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the 
            field of technology, the territory of the Party where the 
            invention was made and whether products are imported or locally 
            produced. 
 
            8.   A Party may revoke a patent only when: 
 
                 (a)  grounds exist that would have justified a refusal to 
                      grant the patent; or 
 
                 (b)  the grant of a compulsory license has not remedied 
                      the lack of exploitation of the patent. 
 

            9.   Each Party shall permit patent owners to assign and 
            transfer by succession their patents, and to conclude licensing 
            contracts. 
 
            10.  Where the law of a Party allows for use of the subject 
            matter of a patent, other than that use allowed under paragraph 
            6, without the authorization of the right holder, including use 
            by the government or other persons authorized by the 
            government, the Party shall respect the following provisions: 
 
                 (a)  authorization of such use shall be considered on its 
                      individual merits; 
 
                 (b)  such use may only be permitted if, prior to such use, 
                      the proposed user has made efforts to obtain 
                      authorization from the right holder on reasonable 
                      commercial terms and conditions and such efforts have 
                      not been successful within a reasonable period of 
                      time.  The requirement to make such efforts may be 
                      waived by a Party in the case of a national emergency 
                      or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases 
                      of public non-commercial use.  In situations of 
                      national emergency or other circumstances of extreme 
                      urgency, the right holder shall, nevertheless, be 
                      notified as soon as reasonably practicable.  In the 
                      case of public non-commercial use, where the 
                      government or contractor, without making a patent 
                      search, knows or has demonstrable grounds to know 
                      that a valid patent is or will be used by or for the 
                      government, the right holder shall be informed 
                      promptly; 
 
                 (c)  the scope and duration of such use shall be limited 
                      to the purpose for which it was authorized; 
 
                 (d)  such use shall be non-exclusive; 
 
                 (e)  such use shall be non-assignable, except with that 
                      part of the enterprise or goodwill that enjoys such 
                      use; 
 
                 (f)  any such use shall be authorized predominantly for 
                      the supply of the Party's domestic market; 
 
                 (g)  authorization for such use shall be liable, subject 
                      to adequate protection of the legitimate interests of 
                      the persons so authorized, to be terminated if and 
                      when the circumstances that led to it cease to exist 
                      and are unlikely to recur.  The competent authority 
                      shall have the authority to review, on motivated 
                      request, the continued existence of these 
                      circumstances; 
 
                 (h)  the right holder shall be paid adequate remuneration 
                      in the circumstances of each case, taking into 
                      account the economic value of the authorization; 
 
                 (i)  the legal validity of any decision relating to the 
                      authorization shall be subject to judicial or other 
                      independent review by a distinct higher authority; 
 
                 (j)  any decision relating to the remuneration provided in 
                      respect of such use shall be subject to judicial or 
                      other independent review by a distinct higher 
                      authority;  
 
                 (k)  the Party shall not be obliged to apply the 
                      conditions set out in subparagraphs (b) and (f) where 
                      such use is permitted to remedy a practice determined 
                      after judicial or administrative process to be 
                      anticompetitive.  The need to correct anticompetitive 
                      practices may be taken into account in determining 
                      the amount of remuneration in such cases.  Competent 
                      authorities shall have the authority to refuse 
                      termination of authorization if and when the 
                      conditions that led to such authorization are likely 
                      to recur;  
 
                 (l)  the Party shall not authorize the use of the subject 
                      matter of a patent to permit the exploitation of 
                      another patent except as a remedy for an adjudicated 
                      violation of domestic laws regarding anticompetitive 
                      practices. 
 
            11.  Where the subject matter of a patent is a process for 
            obtaining a product, each Party shall, in any infringement 
            proceeding, place on the defendant the burden of establishing 
            that the allegedly infringing product was made by a process 
            other than the patented process in one of the following 
            situations: 
 
                 (a)  the product obtained by the patented process is new; 
                      or 
 
                 (b)  a substantial likelihood exists that the allegedly 
                      infringing product was made by the process and the 
                      patent owner has been unable through reasonable 
                      efforts to determine the process actually used.  
 
            In the gathering and evaluation of evidence, the legitimate 
            interests of the defendant in protecting its trade secrets 
            shall be taken into account. 
 
            12.  Each Party shall provide a term of protection for patents 
            of at least 20 years from the date of filing or 17 years from 
            the date of grant.  A Party may extend the term of patent 
            protection, in appropriate cases, to compensate for delays 
            caused by regulatory approval processes. 
 
 
            Article 1710:   Layout Designs of Semiconductor Integrated 
                            Circuits 
 
            1.   Each Party shall protect layout designs (topographies) of 
            integrated circuits ("layout designs") in accordance with 
            Articles 2 through 7, 12 and 16(3), other than Article 6(3), of 
            the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated 
            Circuits as opened for signature on May 26, 1989. 
 
            2.   Subject to paragraph 3, each Party shall make it unlawful 
            for any person without the right holder's authorization to 
            import, sell or otherwise distribute for commercial purposes 
            any of the following: 
 
                 (a)  a protected layout design; 
 
                 (b)  an integrated circuit in which a protected layout 
                      design is incorporated; or  
 
                 (c)  an article incorporating such an integrated circuit, 
                      only insofar as it continues to contain an unlawfully 
                      reproduced layout design. 
 
            3.   No Party may make unlawful any of the acts referred to in 
            paragraph 2 performed in respect of an integrated circuit that 
            incorporates an unlawfully reproduced layout design, or any 
            article that incorporates such an integrated circuit, where the 
            person performing those acts or ordering those acts to be done 
            did not know and had no reasonable ground to know, when it 
            acquired the integrated circuit or article incorporating such 
            an integrated circuit, that it incorporated an unlawfully 
            reproduced layout design. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall provide that, after the person referred 
            to in paragraph 3 has received sufficient notice that the 
            layout design was unlawfully reproduced, such person may 
            perform any of the acts with respect to the stock on hand or 
            ordered before such notice, but shall be liable to pay the 
            right holder for doing so an amount equivalent to a reasonable 
            royalty such as would be payable under a freely negotiated 
            license in respect of such a layout design. 
 
            5.   No Party may permit the compulsory licensing of layout 
            designs of integrated circuits. 
 
            6.   Any Party that requires registration as a condition for 
            protection of a layout design shall provide that the term of 
            protection shall not end before the expiration of a period of 
            10 years counted from the date of: 
 
                 (a)  filing of the application for registration; or 
 
                 (b)  the first commercial exploitation of the layout 
                      design, wherever in the world it occurs. 
 
            7.   Where a Party does not require registration as a condition 
            for protection of a layout design, the Party shall provide a 
            term of protection of not less than 10 years from the date of 
            the first commercial exploitation of the layout design, 
            wherever in the world it occurs. 
 
            8.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 6 and 7, a Party may provide 
            that the protection shall lapse 15 years after the creation of 
            the layout design. 
 
            9.   Annex 1710.9 applies to the Parties specified in that 
            Annex. 
 
 
            Article 1711:   Trade Secrets 
 
            1.   Each Party shall provide the legal means for any person to 
            prevent trade secrets from being disclosed to, acquired by, or 
            used by others without the consent of the person lawfully in 
            control of the information in a manner contrary to honest 
            commercial practices, in so far as: 
 
                 (a)  the information is secret in the sense that it is 
                      not, as a body or in the precise configuration and 
                      assembly of its components, generally known among or 
                      readily accessible to persons that normally deal with 
                      the kind of information in question; 
 
                 (b)  the information has actual or potential commercial 
                      value because it is secret; and 
 
                 (c)  the person lawfully in control of the information has 
                      taken reasonable steps under the circumstances to 
                      keep it secret. 
 
            2.   A Party may require that to qualify for protection a trade 
            secret must be evidenced in documents, electronic or magnetic 
            means, optical discs, microfilms, films or other similar 
            instruments. 
 
            3.   No Party may limit the duration of protection for trade 
            secrets, so long as the conditions in paragraph 1 exist. 
 
            4.   No Party may discourage or impede the voluntary licensing 
            of trade secrets by imposing excessive or discriminatory 
            conditions on such licenses or conditions that dilute the value 
            of the trade secrets. 
 
            5.   If a Party requires, as a condition for approving the 
            marketing of pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical products 
            that utilize new chemical entities, the submission of 
            undisclosed test or other data necessary to determine whether 
            the use of such products is safe and effective, the Party shall 
            protect against disclosure of the data of persons making such 
            submissions, where the origination of such data involves 
            considerable effort, except where the disclosure is necessary 
            to protect the public or unless steps are taken to ensure that 
            the data is protected against unfair commercial use. 
 
            6.   Each Party shall provide that for data subject to 
            paragraph 5 that are submitted to the Party after the date of 
            entry into force of this Agreement, no person other than the 
            person that submitted them may, without the latter's 
            permission, rely on such data in support of an application for 
            product approval during a reasonable period of time after their 
            submission.  For this purpose, a reasonable period shall 
            normally mean not less than five years from the date on which 
            the Party granted approval to the person that produced the data 
            for approval to market its product, taking account of the 
            nature of the data and the person's efforts and expenditures in 
            producing them.  Subject to this provision, there shall be no 
            limitation on any Party to implement abbreviated approval 
            procedures for such products on the basis of bioequivalence and 
            bioavailability studies. 
 
            7.   Where a Party relies on a marketing approval granted by 
            another Party, the reasonable period of exclusive use of the 
            data submitted in connection with obtaining the approval relied 
            on shall begin with the date of the first marketing approval 
            relied on. 
 
 
            Article 1712:   Geographical Indications 
 
            1.   Each Party shall provide, in respect of geographical 
            indications, the legal means for interested persons to prevent: 
 
                 (a)  the use of any means in the designation or 
                      presentation of a good that indicates or suggests 
                      that the good in question originates in a territory, 
                      region or locality other than the true place of 
                      origin, in a manner that misleads the public as to 
                      the geographical origin of the good; 
 
                 (b)  any use that constitutes an act of unfair competition 
                      within the meaning of Article 10bis of the Paris 
                      Convention. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall, on its own initiative if its domestic 
            law so permits or at the request of an interested person, 
            refuse to register, or invalidate the registration of, a 
            trademark containing or consisting of a geographical indication 
            with respect to goods that do not originate in the indicated 
            territory, region or locality, if use of the indication in the 
            trademark for such goods is of such a nature as to mislead the 
            public as to the geographical origin of the good. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall also apply paragraphs 1 and 2 to a 
            geographical indication that, although correctly indicating the 
            territory, region or locality in which the goods originate, 
            falsely represents to the public that the goods originate in 
            another territory, region or locality. 
 
            4.   Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require a 
            Party to prevent continued and similar use of a particular 
            geographical indication of another Party in connection with 
            goods or services by any of its nationals or domiciliaries who 
            have used that geographical indication in a continuous manner 
            with regard to the same or related goods or services in that 
            Party's territory, either: 
 
                 (a)   for at least 10 years, or 
 
                 (b)  in good faith,  
 
            before the date of signature of this Agreement. 
 
            5.   Where a trademark has been applied for or registered in 
            good faith, or where rights to a trademark have been acquired 
            through use in good faith, either: 
 
                 (a)  before the date of application of these provisions in 
                      that Party, or 
 
                 (b)  before the geographical indication is protected in 
                      its Party of origin, 
 
            no Party may adopt any measure to implement this Article that 
            prejudices eligibility for, or the validity of, the 
            registration of a trademark, or the right to use a trademark, 
            on the basis that such a trademark is identical with, or 
            similar to, a geographical indication. 
 
            6.   No Party shall be required to apply this Article to a 
            geographical indication if it is identical to the customary 
            term in common language in that Party's territory for the goods 
            or services to which the indication applies. 
 
            7.   A Party may provide that any request made under this 
            Article in connection with the use or registration of a 
            trademark must be presented within five years after the adverse 
            use of the protected indication has become generally known in 
            that Party or after the date of registration of the trademark 
            in that Party, provided that the trademark has been published 
            by that date, if such date is earlier than the date on which 
            the adverse use became generally known in that Party, provided 
            that the geographical indication is not used or registered in 
            bad faith. 
 
            8.   No Party shall adopt any measure implementing this Article 
            that would prejudice any person's right to use, in the course 
            of trade, its name or the name of its predecessor in business, 
            except where such name forms all or part of a valid trademark 
            in existence before the geographical indication became 
            protected and with which there is a likelihood of confusion, or 
            such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public. 
 
            9.   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a 
            Party to protect a geographical indication that is not 
            protected, or has fallen into disuse, in the Party of origin. 
 
 
            Article 1713: Industrial Designs 
 
            1.   Each Party shall provide for the protection of 
            independently created industrial designs that are new or 
            original.  A Party may provide that: 
 
                 (a)  designs are not new or original if they do not 
                      significantly differ from known designs or 
                      combinations of known design features; and 
 
                 (b)  such protection shall not extend to designs dictated 
                      essentially by technical or functional 
                      considerations. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall ensure that the requirements for securing 
            protection for textile designs, in particular in regard to any 
            cost, examination or publication, do not unreasonably impair a 
            person's opportunity to seek and obtain such protection.  A 
            Party may comply with this obligation through industrial design 
            law or copyright law. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall provide the owner of a protected 
            industrial design the right to prevent other persons not having 
            the owner's consent from making or selling articles bearing or 
            embodying a design that is a copy, or substantially a copy, of 
            the protected design, when such acts are undertaken for 
            commercial purposes. 
 
            4.   A Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection 
            of industrial designs, provided that such exceptions do not 
            unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected 
            industrial designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the 
            legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, 
            taking into account the legitimate interests of other persons.  
 
            5.   Each Party shall provide a term of protection for 
            industrial designs of at least 10 years. 
 
 
            Article 1714:   Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights: 
                            General Provisions 
 
            1.   Each Party shall ensure that enforcement procedures, as 
            specified in this Article and Articles 1715 through 1718, are 
            available under its domestic law so as to permit effective 
            action to be taken against any act of infringement of 
            intellectual property rights covered by this Chapter, including 
            expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies to 
            deter further infringements.  Such enforcement procedures shall 
            be applied so as to avoid the creation of barriers to 
            legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against abuse of 
            the procedures. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall ensure that its procedures for the 
            enforcement of intellectual property rights are fair and 
            equitable, are not unnecessarily complicated or costly, and do 
            not entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall provide that decisions on the merits of a 
            case in judicial and administrative enforcement proceedings 
            shall: 
 
                 (a)  preferably be in writing and preferably state the 
                      reasons on which the decisions are based; 
 
                 (b)  be made available at least to the parties in a 
                      proceeding without undue delay; and 
 
                 (c)  be based only on evidence in respect of which such 
                      parties were offered the opportunity to be heard. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall ensure that parties in a proceeding have 
            an opportunity to have final administrative decisions reviewed 
            by a judicial authority of that Party and, subject to 
            jurisdictional provisions in its domestic laws concerning the 
            importance of a case, to have reviewed at least the legal 
            aspects of initial judicial decisions on the merits of a case.  
            Notwithstanding the above, no Party shall be required to 
            provide for judicial review of acquittals in criminal cases. 
 
            5.   Nothing in this Article or Articles 1715 through 1718 
            shall be construed to require a Party to establish a judicial 
            system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights 
            distinct from that Party's system for the enforcement of laws 
            in general. 
 
            6.   For the purposes of Articles 1715 through 1718, the term 
            "right holder" includes federations and associations having 
            legal standing to assert such rights. 
 
 
            Article 1715:   Specific Procedural and Remedial Aspects of 
                            Civil and Administrative Procedures 
 
            1.   Each Party shall make available to right holders civil 
            judicial procedures for the enforcement of any intellectual 
            property right provided in this Chapter.  Each Party shall 
            provide that: 
 
                 (a)  defendants have the right to written notice that is 
                      timely and contains sufficient detail, including the 
                      basis of the claims; 
 
                 (b)  parties in a proceeding are allowed to be represented 
                      by independent legal counsel; 
 
                 (c)  the procedures do not include imposition of overly 
                      burdensome requirements concerning mandatory personal 
                      appearances; 
 
                 (d)  all parties in a proceeding are duly entitled to 
                      substantiate their claims and to present relevant 
                      evidence; and 
 
                 (e)  the procedures include a means to identify and 
                      protect confidential information. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities 
            shall have the authority: 
 
                 (a)  where a party in a proceeding has presented 
                      reasonably available evidence sufficient to support 
                      its claims and has specified evidence relevant to the 
                      substantiation of its claims that is within the 
                      control of the opposing party, to order the opposing 
                      party to produce such evidence, subject in 
                      appropriate cases to conditions that ensure the 
                      protection of confidential information; 
 
                 (b)  where a party in a proceeding voluntarily and without 
                      good reason refuses access to, or otherwise does not 
                      provide relevant evidence under that party's control 
                      within a reasonable period, or significantly impedes 
                      a proceeding relating to an enforcement action, to 
                      make preliminary and final determinations, 
                      affirmative or negative, on the basis of the evidence 
                      presented, including the complaint or the allegation 
                      presented by the party adversely affected by the 
                      denial of access to evidence, subject to providing 
                      the parties an opportunity to be heard on the 
                      allegations or evidence; 
 
                 (c)  to order a party in a proceeding to desist from an 
                      infringement, including to prevent the entry into the 
                      channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of 
                      imported goods that involve the infringement of an 
                      intellectual property right, which order shall be 
                      enforceable at least immediately after customs 
                      clearance of such goods;  
 
                 (d)  to order the infringer of an intellectual property 
                      right to pay the right holder damages adequate to 
                      compensate for the injury the right holder has 
                      suffered because of the infringement where the 
                      infringer knew or had reasonable grounds to know that 
                      it was engaged in an infringing activity; 
 
                 (e)  to order an infringer of an intellectual property 
                      right to pay the right holder's expenses, which may 
                      include appropriate attorney's fees; and 
 
                 (f)  to order a party in a proceeding at whose request 
                      measures were taken and who has abused enforcement 
                      procedures to provide adequate compensation to any 
                      party wrongfully enjoined or restrained in the 
                      proceeding for the injury suffered because of such 
                      abuse and to pay that party's expenses, which may 
                      include appropriate attorney's fees. 
 
            3.   With respect to the authority referred to in subparagraph 
            2(c), no Party shall be obliged to provide such authority in 
            respect of protected subject matter that is acquired or ordered 
            by a person before that person knew or had reasonable grounds 
            to know that dealing in that subject matter would entail the 
            infringement of an intellectual property right. 
 
            4.   With respect to the authority referred to in subparagraph 
            2(d), a Party may, at least with respect to copyrighted works 
            and sound recordings, authorize the judicial authorities to 
            order recovery of profits or payment of pre-established 
            damages, or both, even where the infringer did not know or had 
            no reasonable grounds to know that it was engaged in an 
            infringing activity. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall provide that, in order to create an 
            effective deterrent to infringement, its judicial authorities 
            shall have the authority to order that: 
 
                 (a)  goods that they have found to be infringing be, 
                      without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside 
                      the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid 
                      any injury caused to the right holder or, unless this 
                      would be contrary to existing constitutional 
                      requirements, destroyed; and 
 
                 (b)  materials and implements the predominant use of which 
                      has been in the creation of the infringing goods be, 
                      without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside 
                      the channels of commerce in such a manner as to 
                      minimize the risks of further infringements. 
 
            In considering whether to issue such an order, judicial 
            authorities shall take into account the need for 
            proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and 
            the remedies ordered as well as the interests of other persons. 

            In regard to counterfeit goods, the simple removal of the 
            trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other 
            than in exceptional cases, to permit release of the goods into 
            the channels of commerce. 
 
            6.   In respect of the administration of any law pertaining to 
            the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights, 
            each Party shall only exempt both public authorities and 
            officials from liability to appropriate remedial measures where 
            actions are taken or intended in good faith in the course of 
            the administration of such laws. 
 
            7.   Notwithstanding the other provisions of Articles 1714 
            through 1718, where a Party is sued with respect to an 
            infringement of an intellectual property right as a result of 
            its use of that right or use on its behalf, that Party may 
            limit the remedies available against it to the payment to the 
            right holder of adequate remuneration in the circumstances of 
            each case, taking into account the economic value of the use. 
 
            8.   Each Party shall provide that, where a civil remedy can be 
            ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits 
            of a case, such procedures shall conform to principles 
            equivalent in substance to those set out in this Article. 
 
 
            Article 1716:   Provisional Measures 
 
            1.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities 
            shall have the authority to order prompt and effective 
            provisional measures: 
 
                 (a)  to prevent an infringement of any intellectual 
                      property right, and in particular to prevent the 
                      entry into the channels of commerce in their 
                      jurisdiction of allegedly infringing goods, including 
                      measures to prevent the entry of imported goods at 
                      least immediately after customs clearance; and 
 
                 (b)  to preserve relevant evidence in regard to the 
                      alleged infringement. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities 
            shall have the authority to require any applicant for 
            provisional measures to provide to the judicial authorities any 
            evidence reasonably available to that applicant that the 
            judicial authorities consider necessary to enable them to 
            determine with a sufficient degree of certainty whether: 
 
                 (a)  the applicant is the right holder; 
 
                 (b)  the applicant's right is being infringed or such 
                      infringement is imminent; and 
 
                 (c)  any delay in the issuance of such measures is likely 
                      to cause irreparable harm to the right holder, or 
                      there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being 
                      destroyed. 
 
            Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall 
            have the authority to require the applicant to provide a 
            security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the 
            interests of the defendant and to prevent abuse. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities 
            shall have the authority to require an applicant for 
            provisional measures to provide other information necessary for 
            the identification of the relevant goods by the authority that 
            will execute the provisional measures. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities 
            shall have the authority to order provisional measures on an ex 
            parte basis, in particular where any delay is likely to cause 
            irreparable harm to the right holder, or where there is a 
            demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall provide that where provisional measures 
            are adopted by that Party's judicial authorities on an ex parte 
            basis: 
 
                 (a)  a person affected shall be given notice of those 
                      measures without delay but in any event no later than 
                      immediately after the execution of the measures; 
 
                 (b)  a defendant shall, on request, have those measures 
                      reviewed by that Party's judicial authorities for the 
                      purpose of deciding, within a reasonable period after 
                      notice of those measures is given, whether the 
                      measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed, and 
                      shall be given an opportunity to be heard in the 
                      review proceedings. 
 
            6.   Without prejudice to paragraph 5, each Party shall provide 
            that, on the request of the defendant, the Party's judicial 
            authorities shall revoke or otherwise cease to apply the 
            provisional measures taken on the basis of paragraphs 1 and 4 
            if proceedings leading to a decision on the merits are not 
            initiated: 
 
                 (a)  within a reasonable period as determined by the 
                      judicial authority ordering the measures where the 
                      Party's domestic law so permits; or 
 
                 (b)  in the absence of such a determination, within a 
                      period of no more than 20 working days or 31 calendar 
                      days, whichever is longer. 
 
            7.   Each Party shall provide that, where the provisional 
            measures are revoked or where they lapse due to any act or 
            omission by the applicant, or where the judicial authorities 
            subsequently find that there has been no infringement or threat 
            of infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial 
            authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant, on 
            request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate 
            compensation for any injury caused by these measures. 
 
            8.   Each Party shall provide that, where a provisional measure 
            can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures, such 
            procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance 
            to those set out in this Article. 
 
 
            Article 1717:   Criminal Procedures and Penalties 
 
            1.   Each Party shall provide criminal procedures and penalties 
            to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark 
            counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale.  Each 
            Party shall provide that penalties available include 
            imprisonment or monetary fines, or both, sufficient to provide 
            a deterrent, consistent with the level of penalties applied for 
            crimes of a corresponding gravity. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall provide that, in appropriate cases, its 
            judicial authorities may order the seizure, forfeiture and 
            destruction of infringing goods and of any materials and 
            implements the predominant use of which has been in the 
            commission of the offense. 
 
            3.   A Party may provide criminal procedures and penalties to 
            be applied in cases of infringement of intellectual property 
            rights, other than those in paragraph 1, where they are 
            committed wilfully and on a commercial scale. 
 
 
            Article 1718:   Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights at 
                            the Border 
 
            1.   Each Party shall, in conformity with this Article, adopt 
            procedures to enable a right holder, who has valid grounds for 
            suspecting that the importation of counterfeit trademark goods 
            or pirated copyright goods may take place, to lodge an 
            application in writing with its competent authorities, whether 
            administrative or judicial, for the suspension by the customs 
            administration of the release of such goods into free 
            circulation.  No Party shall be obligated to apply such 
            procedures to goods in transit.  A Party may permit such an 
            application to be made in respect of goods that involve other 
            infringements of intellectual property rights, provided that 
            the requirements of this Article are met.  A Party may also 
            provide for corresponding procedures concerning the suspension 
            by the customs administration of the release of infringing 
            goods destined for exportation from its territory. 
 
            2.   Each Party shall require any applicant who initiates 
            procedures under paragraph 1 to provide adequate evidence: 
 
                 (a)  to satisfy that Party's competent authorities that, 
                      under the domestic laws of the country of 
                      importation, there is prima facie an infringement of 
                      its intellectual property right; and  
 
                 (b)  to supply a sufficiently detailed description of the 
                      goods to make them readily recognizable by the 
                      customs administration. 
 
            The competent authorities shall inform the applicant within a 
            reasonable period whether they have accepted the application 
            and, if so, the period for which the customs administration 
            will take action. 
 
            3.   Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities 
            shall have the authority to require an applicant under 
            paragraph 1 to provide a security or equivalent assurance 
            sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent 
            authorities and to prevent abuse.  Such security or equivalent 
            assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these 
            procedures. 
 
            4.   Each Party shall provide that, where pursuant to an 
            application under procedures adopted pursuant to this Article, 
            its customs administration suspends the release of goods 
            involving industrial designs, patents, integrated circuits or 
            trade secrets into free circulation on the basis of a decision 
            other than by a judicial or other independent authority, and 
            the period provided for in paragraphs 6 through 8 has expired 
            without the granting of provisional relief by the duly 
            empowered authority, and provided that all other conditions for 
            importation have been complied with, the owner, importer or 
            consignee of such goods shall be entitled to their release on 
            the posting of a security in an amount sufficient to protect 
            the right holder against any infringement.  Payment of such 
            security shall not prejudice any other remedy available to the 
            right holder, it being understood that the security shall be 
            released if the right holder fails to pursue its right of 
            action within a reasonable period of time. 
 
            5.   Each Party shall provide that its customs administration 
            shall promptly notify the importer and the applicant when the 
            customs administration suspends the release of goods pursuant 
            to paragraph 1. 
 
            6.   Each Party shall provide that its customs administration 
            shall release goods from suspension if within a period not 
            exceeding 10 working days after the applicant under paragraph 1 
            has been served notice of the suspension the customs 
            administration has not been informed that: 
 
                  (a)  a party other than the defendant has initiated 
                      proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of 
                      the case, or 
 
                 (b)  a competent authority has taken provisional measures 
                      prolonging the suspension, 
 
            provided that all other conditions for importation or 
            exportation have been met.  Each Party shall provide that, in 
            appropriate cases, the customs administration may extend the 
            suspension by another 10 working days. 
 
            7.   Each Party shall provide that if proceedings leading to a 
            decision on the merits of the case have been initiated, a 
            review, including a right to be heard, shall take place on 
            request of the defendant with a view to deciding, within a 
            reasonable period, whether these measures shall be modified, 
            revoked or confirmed. 
 
            8.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 6 and 7, where the suspension 
            of the release of goods is carried out or continued in 
            accordance with a provisional judicial measure, Article 1716(6) 
            shall apply. 
 
            9.   Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities 
            shall have the authority to order the applicant under paragraph 
            1 to pay the importer, the consignee and the owner of the goods 
            appropriate compensation for any injury caused to them through 
            the wrongful detention of goods or through the detention of 
            goods released pursuant to paragraph 6. 
 
            10.  Without prejudice to the protection of confidential 
            information, each Party shall provide that its competent 
            authorities shall have the authority to give the right holder 
            sufficient opportunity to have any goods detained by the 
            customs administration inspected in order to substantiate the 
            right holder's claims.  Each Party shall also provide that its 
            competent authorities have the authority to give the importer 
            an equivalent opportunity to have any such goods inspected.  
            Where the competent authorities have made a positive 
            determination on the merits of a case, a Party may provide the 
            competent authorities the authority to inform the right holder 
            of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer and 
            the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question. 
 
            11.  Where a Party requires its competent authorities to act on 
            their own initiative and to suspend the release of goods in 
            respect of which they have acquired prima facie evidence that 
            an intellectual property right is being infringed: 
 
                  (a)  the competent authorities may at any time seek from 
                      the right holder any information that may assist them 
                      to exercise these powers; 
 
                 (b)  the importer and the right holder shall be promptly 
                      notified of the suspension by the Party's competent 
                      authorities, and where the importer lodges an appeal 
                      against the suspension with competent authorities, 
                      the suspension shall be subject to the conditions, 
                      with such modifications as may be necessary, set out 
                      in paragraphs 6 through 8; and 
 
                 (c)  the Party shall only exempt both public authorities 
                      and officials from liability to appropriate remedial 
                      measures where actions are taken or intended in good 
                      faith. 
 
            12.  Without prejudice to other rights of action open to the 
            right holder and subject to the defendant's right to seek 
            judicial review, each Party shall provide that its competent 
            authorities shall have the authority to order the destruction 
            or disposal of infringing goods in accordance with the 
            principles set out in Article 1715(5).  In regard to 
            counterfeit goods, the authorities shall not allow the re- 
            exportation of the infringing goods in an unaltered state or 
            subject them to a different customs procedure, other than in 
            exceptional circumstances. 
 
            13.  A Party may exclude from the application of paragraphs 1 
            through 12 small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature 
            contained in travellers' personal luggage or sent in small 
            consignments that are not repetitive. 
 
            14.  Annex 1718.14 applies to the Parties specified in that 
            Annex.

            terms with technical assistance and shall promote cooperation 
            between their competent authorities.  Such cooperation shall 
            include the training of personnel. 
 
            2.   The Parties shall cooperate with a view to eliminating 
            trade in goods that infringe intellectual property rights.  For 
            this purpose, each Party shall establish and notify the other 
            Parties by January 1, 1994 of contact points in its federal 
            government and shall exchange information concerning trade in

            provisions of this Agreement for the Party in question. 
 
            2.   Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, each

            on the date of application of the relevant provisions of this 
            Agreement for the Party in question and that is protected in a 
            Party on such date, or that meets or subsequently meets the 
            criteria for protection under the terms of this Chapter.  In 
            respect of this paragraph and paragraphs 3 and 4, a Party's 
            obligations with respect to existing works shall be solely 
            determined under Article 18 of the Berne Convention and with 
            respect to the rights of producers of sound recordings in 
            existing sound recordings shall be determined solely under 
            Article 18 of that Convention, as made applicable under this 
            Agreement. 
 
            3.   Except as required under Article 1705(7), and 
            notwithstanding the first sentence of paragraph 2, no Party may 
            be required to restore protection to subject matter that, on 
            the date of application of the relevant provisions of this 
            Agreement for the Party in question, has fallen into the public 
            domain in its territory. 
 
            4.   In respect of any acts relating to specific objects 
            embodying protected subject matter that become infringing under 
            the terms of laws in conformity with this Agreement, and that 
            were begun or in respect of which a significant investment was 
            made, before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for 
            that Party, any Party may provide for a limitation of the 
            remedies available to the right holder as to the continued 
            performance of such acts after the date of application of this 
            Agreement for that Party.  In such cases, the Party shall, 
            however, at least provide for payment of equitable 
            remuneration. 
 
            5.   No Party shall be obliged to apply Article 1705(2)(d) or 
            1706(1)(d) with respect to originals or copies purchased prior 
            to the date of application of the relevant provisions of this 
            Agreement for that Party. 
 
            6.   No Party shall be required to apply Article 1709(10), or 
            the requirement in Article 1709(7) that patent rights shall be 
            enjoyable without discrimination as to the field of technology, 
            to use without the authorization of the right holder where 
            authorization for such use was granted by the government before 
            the text of the Draft Final Act Embodying the Results of the 
            Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations became known. 
 
            7.   In the case of intellectual property rights for which 
            protection is conditional on registration, applications for 
            protection that are pending on the date of application of the 
            relevant provisions of this Agreement for the Party in question 
            shall be permitted to be amended to claim any enhanced 
            protection provided under this Agreement.  Such amendments 
            shall not include new matter.

            relevant statutes, legislative history, regulations, 
            administrative practice and judicial precedents. 
 
            2.   Each Party reserves the right to change or modify its 
            antidumping law or countervailing duty law, provided that in 
            the case of an amendment to a Party's antidumping or 
            countervailing duty statute: 
 
                 (a)  such amendment shall apply to goods from another 
                      Party only if the amending statute specifies that it 
                      applies to goods from that Party or from the Parties 
                      to this Agreement; 
 
                 (b)  the amending Party notifies in writing the Parties to 
                      which the amendment applies of the amending statute 
                      as far in advance as possible of the date of 
                      enactment of such statute; 
 
                 (c)  following notification, the amending Party, on 
                      request of any Party to which the amendment applies, 
                      consults with that Party prior to the enactment of 
                      the amending statute; and 
 
                 (d)  such amendment, as applicable to that other Party, is 
                      not inconsistent with 
 
                      (i)  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
                           (GATT), the Agreement on Implementation of 
                           Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
                           and Trade (the Antidumping Code) or the 
                           Agreement on the Interpretation and Application 
                           of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General 
                           Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the Subsidies 
                           Code), or any successor agreement to which all 
                           the original signatories to this Agreement are 
                           party, or 
 
                      (ii) the object and purpose of this Agreement and 
                           this Chapter, which is to establish fair and 
                           predictable conditions for the progressive 
                           liberalization of trade between the Parties to 
                           this Agreement while maintaining effective and 
                           fair disciplines on unfair trade practices, such 
                           object and purpose to be ascertained from the 
                           provisions of this Agreement, its preamble and 
                           objectives, and the practices of the Parties. 
 
 
            Article 1903:  Review of Statutory Amendments 
 
            1.   A Party to which an amendment of another Party's 
            antidumping or countervailing duty statute applies may request 
            in writing that such amendment be referred to a binational 
            panel for a declaratory opinion as to whether: 
 
                 (a)  the amendment does not conform to the provisions of 
                      Article 1902(2)(d)(i) or (ii); or 
 
                 (b)  such amendment has the function and effect of 
                      overturning a prior decision of a panel made pursuant 
                      to Article 1904 and does not conform to the 
                      provisions of Article 1902(2)(d)(i) or (ii). 
 
            Such declaratory opinion shall have force or effect only as 
            provided in this Article. 
 
            2.   The panel shall conduct its review in accordance with the 
            procedures of Annex 1903.2. 
 
            3.   In the event that the panel recommends modifications to 
            the amending statute to remedy a non-conformity that it has 
            identified in its opinion: 
 
                 (a)  the two Parties shall immediately begin consultations 
                      and shall seek to achieve a mutually satisfactory 
                      solution to the matter within 90 days of the issuance 
                      of the panel's final declaratory opinion.  Such 
                      solution may include seeking corrective legislation 
                      with respect to the statute of the amending Party;  
 
                 (b)  if corrective legislation is not enacted within nine 
                      months from the end of the 90-day consultation period 
                      referred to in subparagraph (a) and no other mutually 
                      satisfactory solution has been reached, the Party 
                      that requested the panel may 
 
                      (i)  take comparable legislative or equivalent 
                           executive action, or 
 
                      (ii) terminate this Agreement with regard to the 
                           amending Party on 60-day written notice to that 
                           Party. 
 
 
            Article 1904:  Review of Final Antidumping and Countervailing 
                           Duty Determinations 
 
            1.   As provided in this Article, each Party shall replace 
            judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty 
            determinations with binational panel review. 
 
            2.   An involved Party may request that a panel review, based 
            on the administrative record, a final antidumping or 
            countervailing duty determination of a competent investigating 
            authority of an importing Party to determine whether such 
            determination was in accordance with the antidumping or 
            countervailing duty law of the importing Party.  For this 
            purpose, the antidumping or countervailing duty law consists of 
            the relevant statutes, legislative history, regulations, 
            administrative practice and judicial precedents to the extent 
            that a court of the importing Party would rely on such 
            materials in reviewing a final determination of the competent 
            investigating authority.  Solely for purposes of the panel 
            review provided for in this Article, the antidumping and 
            countervailing duty statutes of the Parties, as those statutes 
            may be amended from time to time, are incorporated into and 
            made a part of this Agreement. 
 
            3.   The panel shall apply the standard of review set out in 
            Annex 1911 and the general legal principles that a court of the 
            importing Party otherwise would apply to a review of a 
            determination of the competent investigating authority. 
 
            4.   A request for a panel shall be made in writing to the 
            other involved Party within 30 days following the date of 
            publication of the final determination in question in the 
            official journal of the importing Party.  In the case of final 
            determinations that are not published in the official journal 
            of the importing Party, the importing Party shall immediately 
            notify the other involved Party of such final determination 
            where it involves goods from the other involved Party, and the 
            other involved Party may request a panel within 30 days of 
            receipt of such notice.  Where the competent investigating 
            authority of the importing Party has imposed provisional 
            measures in an investigation, the other involved Party may 
            provide notice of its intention to request a panel under this 
            Article, and the Parties shall begin to establish a panel at 
            that time.  Failure to request a panel within the time 
            specified in this paragraph shall preclude review by a panel. 
 
            5.   An involved Party on its own initiative may request review 
            of a final determination by a panel and shall, on request of a 
            person who would otherwise be entitled under the law of the 
            importing Party to commence domestic procedures for judicial 
            review of that final determination, request such review. 
 
            6.   The panel shall conduct its review in accordance with the 
            procedures established by the Parties pursuant to paragraph 14. 

            Where both involved Parties request a panel to review a final 
            determination, a single panel shall review that determination. 
 
            7.   The competent investigating authority that issued the 
            final determination in question shall have the right to appear 
            and be represented by counsel before the panel.  Each Party 
            shall provide that other persons who, pursuant to the law of 
            the importing Party, otherwise would have had the right to 
            appear and be represented in a domestic judicial review 
            proceeding concerning the determination of the competent 
            investigating authority, shall have the right to appear and be 
            represented by counsel before the panel. 
 
            8.   The panel may uphold a final determination, or remand it 
            for action not inconsistent with the panel's decision.  Where 
            the panel remands a final determination, the panel shall 
            establish as brief a time as is reasonable for compliance with 
            the remand, taking into account the complexity of the factual 
            and legal issues involved and the nature of the panel's 
            decision.  In no event shall the time permitted for compliance 
            with a remand exceed an amount of time equal to the maximum 
            amount of time (counted from the date of the filing of a 
            petition, complaint or application) permitted by statute for 
            the competent investigating authority in question to make a 
            final determination in an investigation.  If review of the 
            action taken by the competent investigating authority on remand 
            is needed, such review shall be before the same panel, which 
            shall normally issue a final decision within 90 days of the 
            date on which such remand action is submitted to it. 
 
            9.   The decision of a panel under this Article shall be 
            binding on the involved Parties with respect to the particular 
            matter between the Parties that is before the panel. 
 
            10.  This Agreement shall not affect:  
 
                 (a)  the judicial review procedures of any Party, or 
 
                 (b)  cases appealed under those procedures,  
 
            with respect to determinations other than final determinations. 
 
            11.  A final determination shall not be reviewed under any 
            judicial review procedures of the importing Party if an 
            involved Party requests a panel with respect to that 
            determination within the time limits set out in this Article.  
            No Party may provide in its domestic legislation for an appeal 
            from a panel decision to its domestic courts. 
 
            12.  This Article shall not apply where: 
 
                 (a)  neither involved Party seeks panel review of a final 
                      determination;  
 
                 (b)  a revised final determination is issued as a direct 
                      result of judicial review of the original final 
                      determination by a court of the importing Party in 
                      cases where neither involved Party sought panel 
                      review of that original final determination; or 
 
                 (c)  a final determination is issued as a direct result of 
                      judicial review that was commenced in a court of the 
                      importing Party before the date of entry into force 
                      of this Agreement. 
 
            13.  Where, within a reasonable time after the panel decision 
            is issued, an involved Party alleges that: 
 
                 (a)  (i)  a member of the panel was guilty of gross 
                           misconduct, bias, or a serious conflict of 
                           interest, or otherwise materially violated the 
                           rules of conduct, 
 
                      (ii) the panel seriously departed from a fundamental 
                           rule of procedure, or 
 
                      (iii)     the panel manifestly exceeded its powers, 
                                authority or jurisdiction set out in this 
                                Article, for example by failing to apply 
                                the appropriate standard of review, and 
 
                 (b)  any of the actions set out in subparagraph (a) has 
                      materially affected the panel's decision and 
                      threatens the integrity of the binational panel 
                      review process, 
 
            that Party may avail itself of the extraordinary challenge 
            procedure set out in Annex 1904.13. 
 
            14.  To implement the provisions of this Article, the Parties 
            shall adopt rules of procedure by January 1, 1994.  Such rules 
            shall be based, where appropriate, on judicial rules of 
            appellate procedure, and shall include rules concerning:  the 
            content and service of requests for panels; a requirement that 
            the competent investigating authority transmit to the panel the 
            administrative record of the proceeding; the protection of 
            business proprietary, government classified, and other 
            privileged information (including sanctions against persons 
            participating before panels for improper release of such 
            information); participation by private persons; limitations on 
            panel review to errors alleged by the Parties or private 
            persons; filing and service; computation and extensions of 
            time; the form and content of briefs and other papers; pre- and 
            post-hearing conferences; motions; oral argument; requests for 
            rehearing; and voluntary terminations of panel reviews.  The 
            rules shall be designed to result in final decisions within 
            315 days of the date on which a request for a panel is made, 
            and shall allow: 
 
                 (a)  30 days for the filing of the complaint; 
 
                 (b)  30 days for designation or certification of the 
                      administrative record and its filing with the panel; 
 
                 (c)  60 days for the complainant to file its brief; 
 
                 (d)  60 days for the respondent to file its brief; 
 
                 (e)  15 days for the filing of reply briefs; 
 
                 (f)  15 to 30 days for the panel to convene and hear oral 
                      argument; and 
 
                 (g)  90 days for the panel to issue its written decision. 
  

            15.  In order to achieve the objectives of this Article, the 
            Parties shall amend their antidumping and countervailing duty 
            statutes and regulations with respect to antidumping or 
            countervailing duty proceedings involving goods of the other 
            Parties, and other statutes and regulations to the extent that 
            they apply to the operation of the antidumping and 
            countervailing duty laws.  In particular, without limiting the 
            generality of the foregoing, each Party shall:  
 
                 (a)  amend its statutes or regulations to ensure that 
                      existing procedures concerning the refund, with 
                      interest, of antidumping or countervailing duties 
                      operate to give effect to a final panel decision that 
                      a refund is due; 
 
                 (b)  amend its statutes or regulations to ensure that its 
                      courts shall give full force and effect, with respect 
                      to any person within its jurisdiction, to all 
                      sanctions imposed pursuant to the laws of the other 
                      Parties to enforce provisions of any protective order 
                      or undertaking that such other Party has promulgated 
                      or accepted in order to permit access for purposes of 
                      panel review or of the extraordinary challenge 
                      procedure to confidential, personal, business 
                      proprietary or other privileged information; 
 
                 (c)  amend its statutes or regulations to ensure that 
 
                      (i)  domestic procedures for judicial review of a 
                           final determination may not be commenced until 
                           the time for requesting a panel under paragraph 
                           4 has expired, and 
 
                      (ii) as a prerequisite to commencing domestic 
                           judicial review procedures to review a final 
                           determination, a Party or other person intending 
                           to commence such procedures shall provide notice 
                           of such intent to the Parties concerned and to 
                           other persons entitled to commence such review 
                           procedures of the same final determination no 
                           later than 10 days prior to the latest date on 
                           which a panel may be requested; and 
 
                 (d)  make the further amendments set out in its Schedule 
                      to Annex 1904.15. 
 
 
            Article 1905:  Safeguarding the Panel Review System 
 
            1.   Where a Party alleges that the application of another 
            Party's domestic law: 
 
                 (a)  has prevented the establishment of a panel requested 
                      by the complaining Party; 
 
                 (b)  has prevented a panel requested by the complaining 
                      Party from rendering a final decision; 
 
                 (c)  has prevented the implementation of the decision of a 
                      panel requested by the complaining Party or denied it 
                      binding force and effect with respect to the 
                      particular matter that was before the panel; or  
 
                 (d)  has resulted in a failure to provide opportunity for 
                      review of a final determination by a panel or court 
                      of competent jurisdiction that is independent of the 
                      competent investigating authorities, that examines 
                      the basis for the competent investigating authority's 
                      determination and whether the competent investigating 
                      authority properly applied domestic antidumping and 
                      countervailing duty law in reaching the challenged 
                      determination, and that employs the relevant standard 
                      of review identified in Article 1911, 
 
            the Party may request in writing consultations with the other 
            Party regarding the allegations.   The consultations shall 
            begin within 15 days of the date of the request. 
 
            2.   If the matter has not been resolved within 45 days of the 
            request for consultations, or such other period as the 
            consulting Parties may agree, the complaining Party may request 
            the establishment of a special committee.  
 
            3.   Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Parties, the 
            special committee shall be established within 15 days of a 
            request and perform its functions in a manner consistent with 
            this Chapter. 
 
            4.   The roster for special committees shall be that 
            established under Annex 1904.13. 
 
            5.   The special committee shall comprise three members 
            selected in accordance with the procedures set out in 
            Annex 1904.13. 
 
            6.   The Parties shall establish rules of procedure in 
            accordance with the principles set out in Annex 1905.6. 
 
            7.   Where the special committee makes an affirmative finding 
            with respect to one of the grounds specified in paragraph 1, 
            the complaining Party and the Party complained against shall 
            begin consultations within 10 days thereafter and shall seek to 
            achieve a mutually satisfactory solution within 60 days of the 
            issuance of the committee's report. 
 
            8.   If, within the 60-day period, the Parties are unable to 
            reach a mutually satisfactory solution to the matter, or the 
            Party complained against has not demonstrated to the 
            satisfaction of the special committee that it has corrected the 
            problem or problems with respect to which the committee has 
            made an affirmative finding, the complaining Party may suspend: 
 
                 (a)  the operation of Article 1904 with respect to the 
                      Party complained against; or 
 
                 (b)  the application to the Party complained against of 
                      such benefits under this Agreement as may be 
                      appropriate under the circumstances. 
 
            If the complaining Party decides to take action under this 
            paragraph, it shall do so within 30 days after the end of the 
            60-day consultation period. 
 
            9.   In the event that a complaining Party suspends the 
            operation of Article 1904 with respect to the Party complained 
            against, the latter Party may reciprocally suspend the 
            operation of Article 1904 within 30 days after the suspension 
            of the operation of Article 1904 by the complaining Party.  If 
            either Party decides to suspend the operation of Article 1904, 
            it shall provide written notice of such suspension to the other 
            Party. 
 
            10.  At the request of the Party complained against, the 
            special committee shall reconvene to determine whether: 
 
                 (a)  the suspension of benefits by the complaining Party 
                      pursuant to paragraph 8(b) is manifestly excessive; 
                      or 
 
                 (b)  the Party complained against has corrected the 
                      problem or problems with respect to which the 
                      committee has made an affirmative finding. 
 
            The special committee shall, within 45 days of the request, 
            present a report to both Parties containing its determination.  
            Where the special committee determines that the Party 
            complained against has corrected the problem or problems, any 
            suspension effected by the complaining Party or the Party 
            complained against, or both, pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 shall 
            be terminated. 
 
            11.  If the special committee makes an affirmative finding with 
            respect to one of the grounds specified in paragraph 1, then 
            effective as of the day following the date of issuance of the 
            special committee's report: 
 
                 (a)  binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee 
                      review under Article 1904 shall be stayed 
 
                      (i)  in the case of review of any final determination 
                           of the complaining Party requested by the Party 
                           complained against, if such review was requested 
                           after the date on which consultations were 
                           requested pursuant to paragraph 1, and in no 
                           case more than 150 days prior to an affirmative 
                           finding by the special committee, or 
 
                      (ii) in the case of review of any final determination 
                           of the Party complained against requested by the 
                           complaining Party, at the request of the 
                           complaining Party; and  
 
                 (b)  the time set out in Article 1904(4) or Annex 1904.13 
                      for requesting panel or committee review shall not 
                      run unless and until resumed in accordance with 
                      paragraph 12. 
 
            12.  If either Party suspends the operation of Article 1904 
            pursuant to paragraph 8(a), the panel or committee review 
            stayed under paragraph 11(a) shall be terminated and the 
            challenge to the final determination shall be irrevocably 
            referred to the appropriate domestic court for decision, as 
            provided below: 
 
                 (a)  in the case of review of any final determination of 
                      the complaining Party requested by the Party 
                      complained against, at the request of either Party, 
                      or of a party to the panel review under Article 1904; 
                      or 
 
                 (b)  in the case of review of any final determination of 
                      the Party complained against requested by the 
                      complaining Party, at the request of the complaining 
                      Party, or of a person of the complaining Party that 
                      is a party to the panel review under Article 1904. 
 
            If either Party suspends the operation of Article 1904 pursuant 
            to paragraph 8(a), any running of time suspended under 
            paragraph 11(b) shall resume. 
 
            If the suspension of the operation of Article 1904 does not 
            become effective, panel or committee review stayed under 
            paragraph 11(a), and any running of time suspended under 
            paragraph 11(b), shall resume. 
 
            13.  If the complaining Party suspends the application to the 
            Party complained against of such benefits under the Agreement 
            as may be appropriate under the circumstances pursuant to 
            paragraph 8(b), panel or committee review stayed under 
            paragraph 11(a), and any running of time suspended under 
            paragraph 11(b), shall resume. 
 
            14.  Each Party shall provide in its domestic legislation that, 
            in the event of an affirmative finding by the special 
            committee, the time for requesting judicial review of a final 
            antidumping or countervailing duty determination shall not run 
            unless and until the Parties concerned have negotiated a 
            mutually satisfactory solution under paragraph 7, have 
            suspended the operation of Article 1904 or the application of 
            other benefits under paragraph 8. 
 
 
            Article 1906:  Prospective Application 
 
                 This Chapter shall apply only prospectively to: 
 
                 (a)  final determinations of a competent investigating 
                      authority made after the date of entry into force of 
                      this Agreement; and 
 
                 (b)  with respect to declaratory opinions under 
                      Article 1903, amendments to antidumping or 
                      countervailing duty statutes enacted after the date 
                      of entry into force of this Agreement. 
 
 
            Article 1907:  Consultations 
 
            1.   The Parties shall consult annually, or on the request of 
            any Party, to consider any problems that may arise with respect 
            to the implementation or operation of this Chapter and 
            recommend solutions, where appropriate.  The Parties shall each 
            designate one or more officials, including officials of the 
            competent investigating authorities, to be responsible for 
            ensuring that consultations occur, when required, so that the 
            provisions of this Chapter are carried out expeditiously. 
 
            2.   The Parties further agree to consult on: 
 
                 (a)  the potential to develop more effective rules and 
                      disciplines concerning the use of government 
                      subsidies; and 
 
                 (b)  the potential for reliance on a substitute system of 
                      rules for dealing with unfair transborder pricing 
                      practices and government subsidization. 
 
            3.   The competent investigating authorities of the Parties 
            shall consult annually, or on the request of any Party, and may 
            submit reports to the Commission, where appropriate.  In the 
            context of these consultations, the Parties agree that it is 
            desirable in the administration of antidumping and 
            countervailing duty laws to: 
 
                 (a)  publish notice of initiation of investigations in the 
                      importing Party's official journal, setting forth the 
                      nature of the proceeding, the legal authority under 
                      which the proceeding is initiated, and a description 
                      of the goods at issue; 
 
                 (b)  provide notice of the times for submissions of 
                      information and for decisions that the competent 
                      investigating authorities are expressly required by 
                      statute or regulations to make; 
 
                 (c)  provide explicit written notice and instructions as 
                      to the information required from interested parties 
                      and reasonable time to respond to requests for 
                      information;  
 
                 (d)  accord reasonable access to information, noting that 
                      in this context 
 
                      (i)  "reasonable access" means access during the 
                           course of the investigation, to the extent 
                           practicable, so as to permit an opportunity to 
                           present facts and arguments as set out in 
                           paragraph (e); when it is not practicable to 
                           provide access to information during the 
                           investigation in such time as to permit an 
                           opportunity to present facts and arguments, 
                           reasonable access shall mean in time to permit 
                           the adversely affected party to make an informed 
                           decision as to whether to seek judicial or panel 
                           review, and 
 
                      (ii) "access to information" means access to 
                           representatives determined by the competent 
                           investigating authority to be qualified to have 
                           access to information received by that competent 
                           investigating authority, including access to 
                           confidential (business proprietary) information, 
                           but does not include information of such high 
                           degree of sensitivity that its release would 
                           lead to substantial and irreversible harm to the 
                           owner or which is required to be kept 
                           confidential in accordance with domestic 
                           legislation of a Party; any privileges arising 
                           under the domestic law of the importing Party 
                           relating to communications between the competent 
                           investigating authorities and a lawyer in the 
                           employ of, or providing advice to, those 
                           authorities may be maintained; 
 
                 (e)  provide an opportunity for interested parties to 
                      present facts and arguments, to the extent time 
                      permits, including an opportunity to comment on the 
                      preliminary determination of dumping or of 
                      subsidization; 
 
                 (f)  protect confidential (business proprietary) 
                      information received by the competent investigating 
                      authority to ensure that there is no disclosure 
                      except to representatives determined by the competent 
                      investigating authority to be qualified; 
 
                 (g)  prepare administrative records, including 
                      recommendations of official advisory bodies that may 
                      be required to be kept, and any record of ex parte 
                      meetings that may be required to be kept; 
 
                 (h)  provide disclosure of relevant information, including 
                      an explanation of the calculation or the methodology 
                      used to determine the margin of dumping or the amount 
                      of the subsidy, on which any preliminary or final 
                      determination of dumping or of subsidization is 
                      based, within a reasonable time after a request by 
                      interested parties; 
 
                 (i)  provide a statement of reasons concerning the final 
                      determination of dumping or subsidization; and 
 
                 (j)  provide a statement of reasons for final 
                      determinations concerning material injury to a 
                      domestic industry, threat of material injury to a 
                      domestic industry or material retardation of the 
                      establishment of such an industry. 
 
            Inclusion of an item in subparagraphs (a) through (j) is not 
            intended to serve as guidance to a binational panel reviewing a 
            final antidumping or countervailing duty determination pursuant 
            to Article 1904 in determining whether such determination was 
            in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law 
            of the importing Party. 
 
            Article 1908:  Special Secretariat Provisions 
 
            1.   The Parties shall establish a section within the 
            Secretariat established pursuant to Article 2002 to facilitate 
            the operation of this Chapter, including the work of panels or 
            committees that may be convened pursuant to this Chapter. 
 
            2.   The Secretaries of the Secretariat shall act jointly to 
            provide administrative assistance to all panels or committees 
            established pursuant to this Chapter.  The Secretary for the 
            Section of the Party in which a panel or committee proceeding 
            is held shall prepare a record thereof and shall preserve an 
            authentic copy of the same in that Party's Section office.  
            Such Secretary shall, on request, provide to the Secretary for 
            the Section of any other Party a copy of such portion of the 
            record as is requested, except that only public portions of the 
            record shall be provided to the Secretary for the Section of 
            any Party that is not an involved Party. 
 
            3.   Each Secretary shall receive and file all requests, briefs 
            and other papers properly presented to a panel or committee in 
            any proceeding before it that is instituted pursuant to this 
            Chapter and shall number in numerical order all requests for a 
            panel or committee.  The number given to a request shall be the 
            file number for briefs and other papers relating to such 
            request. 
 
            4.   The Secretary for the Section of the Party in which a 
            panel or committee proceeding is held shall forward to the 
            Secretary for the Section of the other involved Party copies of 
            all official letters, documents or other papers received or 
            filed with that Party's Section office pertaining to any 
            proceeding before a panel or committee, except for the 
            administrative record, which shall be handled in accordance 
            with paragraph 1.  The Secretary for the Section of an involved 
            Party shall provide on request to the Secretary for the Section 
            of a Party that is not an involved Party in the proceeding a 
            copy of such public documents as are requested. 
 
 
            Article 1909:  Code of Conduct 
 
                 The Parties shall, by the date of entry into force of this 
            Agreement, exchange letters establishing a code of conduct for

                           Establishment of Binational Panels 
 
 
            1.   On the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the 
            Parties shall establish and thereafter maintain a roster of 
            individuals to serve as panelists in disputes under this 
            Chapter.  The roster shall include judges or former judges to 
            the fullest extent practicable.  The Parties shall consult in 
            developing the roster, which shall include at least 75 
            candidates.  Each Party shall select at least 25 candidates, 
            and all candidates shall be citizens of Canada, Mexico or the 
            United States.  Candidates shall be of good character, high 
            standing and repute, and shall be chosen strictly on the basis 
            of objectivity, reliability, sound judgment and general 
            familiarity with international trade law.  Candidates shall not 
            be affiliated with a Party, and in no event shall a candidate 
            take instructions from a Party.  The Parties shall maintain the 
            roster, and may amend it, when necessary, after consultations. 
 
            2.   A majority of the panelists on each panel shall be lawyers 
            in good standing.  Within 30 days of a request for a panel, 
            each involved Party shall appoint two panelists, in 
            consultation with the other involved Party.  The involved 
            Parties normally shall appoint panelists from the roster.  If a 
            panelist is not selected from the roster, the panelist shall be 
            chosen in accordance with and be subject to the criteria of 
            paragraph 1.  Each involved Party shall have the right to 
            exercise four peremptory challenges, to be exercised 
            simultaneously and in confidence, disqualifying from 
            appointment to the panel up to four candidates proposed by the 
            other involved Party.  Peremptory challenges and the selection 
            of alternative panelists shall occur within 45 days of the 
            request for the panel.  If an involved Party fails to appoint 
            its members to a panel within 30 days or if a panelist is 
            struck and no alternative panelist is selected within 45 days, 
            such panelist shall be selected by lot on the 31st or 46th day, 
            as the case may be, from that Party's candidates on the roster. 
 
            3.   Within 55 days of the request for a panel, the involved 
            Parties shall agree on the selection of a fifth panelist.  If 
            the involved Parties are unable to agree, they shall decide by 
            lot which of them shall select, by the 61st day, the fifth 
            panelist from the roster, excluding candidates eliminated by 
            peremptory challenges. 
 
                              Annex 1901.2                                  
 
            4.   On appointment of the fifth panelist, the panelists shall 
            promptly appoint a chairman from among the lawyers on the panel 
            by majority vote of the panelists.  If there is no majority 
            vote, the chairman shall be appointed by lot from among the 
            lawyers on the panel. 
 
            5.   Decisions of the panel shall be by majority vote and based 
            on the votes of all members of the panel.  The panel shall 
            issue a written decision with reasons, together with any 
            dissenting or concurring opinions of panelists. 
 
            6.   Panelists shall be subject to the code of conduct 
            established pursuant to Article 1909.  If an involved Party 
            believes that a panelist is in violation of the code of 
            conduct, the involved Parties shall consult and if they agree, 
            the panelist shall be removed and a new panelist shall be 
            selected in accordance with the procedures of this Annex. 
 
            7.   When a panel is convened pursuant to Article 1904 each 
            panelist shall be required to sign:  
 
                 (a)  an application for protective order for information 
                      supplied by the United States or its persons covering 
                      business proprietary and other privileged 
                      information;  
 
                 (b)  an undertaking for information supplied by Canada or 
                      its persons covering confidential, personal, business 
                      proprietary and other privileged information; or  
 
                 (c)  an undertaking for information supplied by Mexico or 
                      its persons covering confidential, business 
                      proprietary and other privileged information. 
 
            8.   On a panelist's acceptance of the obligations and terms of 
            an application for protective order or disclosure undertaking, 
            the importing Party shall grant access to the information 
            covered by such order or disclosure undertaking.  Each Party 
            shall establish appropriate sanctions for violations of 
            protective orders or disclosure undertakings issued by or given 
            to any Party.  Each Party shall enforce such sanctions with 
            respect to any person within its jurisdiction.  Failure by a 
            panelist to sign a protective order or disclosure undertaking 
            shall result in disqualification of the panelist. 
 
            9.   If a panelist becomes unable to fulfill panel duties or is 
            disqualified, proceedings of the panel shall be suspended 
 
                         Annex 1901.2                                       
     
            pending the selection of a substitute panelist in accordance 
            with the procedures of this Annex. 
 
            10.  Subject to the code of conduct established pursuant to 
            Article 1909, and provided that it does not interfere with the 
            performance of the duties of such panelist, a panelist may 
            engage in other business during the term of the panel. 
 
            11.  While acting as a panelist, a panelist may not appear as 
            counsel before another panel. 
 
            12.  With the exception of violations of protective orders or 
            disclosure undertakings, signed pursuant to paragraph 7, 
            panelists shall be immune from suit and legal process relating 
            to acts performed by them in their official capacity. 
 
                                   Annex 1903.2 
 
                          Panel Procedures Under Article 1903 
 
 
            1.   The panel shall establish its own rules of procedure 
            unless the Parties otherwise agree prior to the establishment 
            of that panel.  The procedures shall ensure a right to at least 
            one hearing before the panel, as well as the opportunity to 
            provide written submissions and rebuttal arguments.  The 
            proceedings of the panel shall be confidential, unless the two 
            Parties otherwise agree.  The panel shall base its decisions 
            solely on the arguments and submissions of the two Parties. 
 
            2.   Unless the Parties to the dispute otherwise agree, the 
            panel shall, within 90 days after its chairman is appointed, 
            present to the two Parties an initial written declaratory 
            opinion containing findings of fact and its determination 
            pursuant to Article 1903. 
 
            3.   If the findings of the panel are affirmative, the panel 
            may include in its report its recommendations as to the means 
            by which the amending statute could be brought into conformity 
            with the provisions of Article 1902(2)(d).  In determining 
            what, if any, recommendations are appropriate, the panel shall 
            consider the extent to which the amending statute affects 
            interests under this Agreement.  Individual panelists may 
            provide separate opinions on matters not unanimously agreed.  
            The initial opinion of the panel shall become the final 
            declaratory opinion, unless a Party to the dispute requests a 
            reconsideration of the initial opinion pursuant to paragraph 4. 
 
            4.   Within 14 days of the issuance of the initial declaratory 
            opinion, a Party to the dispute disagreeing in whole or in part 
            with the opinion may present a written statement of its 
            objections and the reasons for those objections to the panel.  
            In such event, the panel shall request the views of both 
            Parties and shall reconsider its initial opinion.  The panel 
            shall conduct any further examination that it deems 
            appropriate, and shall issue a final written opinion, together 
            with dissenting or concurring views of individual panelists, 
            within 30 days of the request for reconsideration. 
 
            5.   Unless the Parties to the dispute otherwise agree, the 
            final declaratory opinion of the panel shall be made public, 
            along with any separate opinions of individual panelists and 
            any written views that either Party may wish to be published. 

                                 Annex 1903.2                               

            6.   Unless the Parties to the dispute otherwise agree, 
            meetings and hearings of the panel shall take place at the 
            office of the amending Party's Section of the Secretariat. 
 
                                 Annex 1904.13 
 
                           Extraordinary Challenge Procedure 
 
 
            1.   The involved Parties shall establish an extraordinary 
            challenge committee, composed of three members, within 15 days 
            of a request pursuant to Article 1904(13).  The members shall 
            be selected from a 15-person roster comprised of judges or 
            former judges of a federal judicial court of the United States 
            or a judicial court of superior jurisdiction of Canada, or a 
            federal judicial court of Mexico.  Each Party shall name five 
            persons to this roster.  Each involved Party shall select one 
            member from this roster and the involved Parties shall decide 
            by lot which of them shall select the third member from the 
            roster. 
 
            2.   The Parties shall establish by the date of entry into 
            force of the Agreement rules of procedure for committees.  The 
            rules shall provide for a decision of a committee within 
            90 days of its establishment. 
 
            3.   Committee decisions shall be binding on the Parties with 
            respect to the particular matter between the Parties that was 
            before the panel.  After examination of the legal and factual 
            analysis underlying the findings and conclusions of the panel's 
            decision in order to determine whether one of the grounds set 
            out in Article 1904(13) has been established, and on finding 
            that one of those grounds has been established, the committee 
            shall vacate the original panel decision or remand it to the 
            original panel for action not inconsistent with the committee's 
            decision; if the grounds are not established, it shall deny the 
            challenge and, therefore, the original panel decision shall 
            stand affirmed.  If the original decision is vacated, a new 
            panel shall be established pursuant to Annex 1901.2. 
 
                                     Annex 1904.15

            Act, as amended, to render that section inapplicable to the

            or regulations that persons (including producers of goods 
            subject to an investigation) have standing to ask Canada to 
            request a panel review where such persons would be entitled to 
            commence domestic procedures for judicial review if the final 
            determination were reviewable by the Federal Court pursuant to 
            section 18.1(4). 
 
            3.   Canada shall amend the Special Import Measures Act, as

            Act, as amended, to provide for binational panel review 
            respecting goods of Mexico and the United States.

            7.   Canada shall amend Part II of the Special Import Measures 
            Act, as amended, to provide for the establishment of binational 
            panels requested to review final determinations in respect of 
            goods of Mexico and the United States. 
 
            8.   Canada shall amend Part II of the Special Import Measures 
            Act, as amended, to provide that binational panel review of a

                                       PART EIGHT 
                                    OTHER PROVISIONS 
 
                                  Chapter Twenty-One  
 
                                       Exceptions 
 
 
            Article 2101:  General Exceptions 
 
            1.   For purposes of: 
 
                 (a)  Part Two (Trade in Goods), except to the extent that 
                      a provision of that Part applies to services or 
                      investment, and 
 
                 (b)  Part Three (Technical Barriers to Trade), except to 
                      the extent that a provision of that Part applies to 
                      services, 
 
            GATT Article XX and its interpretative notes, or any equivalent 
            provision of a successor agreement to which all Parties are 
            party, are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.  
            The Parties understand that the measures referred to in GATT 
            Article XX(b) include environmental measures necessary to 
            protect human, animal or plant life or health, and that GATT 
            Article XX(g) applies to measures relating to the conservation 
            of living and non-living exhaustible natural resources. 
 
            2.   Provided that such measures are not applied in a manner 
            that would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable 
            discrimination between countries where the same conditions 
            prevail or a disguised restriction on trade between the 
            Parties, nothing in: 
 
                 (a)  Part Two (Trade in Goods), to the extent that a 
                      provision of that Part applies to services, 
 
                 (b)  Part Three (Technical Barriers to Trade), to the 
                      extent that a provision of that Part applies to 
                      services, 
 
                 (c)  Chapter Twelve (Cross-Border Trade in Services), and 
 
                 (d)  Chapter Thirteen (Telecommunications),  
 
            shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by 
            any Party of measures necessary to secure compliance with laws 
            or regulations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of 
            this Agreement, including those relating to health and safety 
            and consumer protection. 
 
            Article 2102:  National Security 
 
            1.   Subject to Articles 607 (Energy - National Security 
            Measures) and 1018 (Government Procurement - Exceptions), 
            nothing in this Agreement shall be construed: 
 
                 (a)  to require any Party to furnish or allow access to 
                      any information the disclosure of which it determines 
                      to be contrary to its essential security interests; 
 
                 (b)  to prevent any Party from taking any actions that it 
                      considers necessary for the protection of its 
                      essential security interests 
 
                      (i)  relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and 
                           implements of war and to such traffic and 
                           transactions in other goods, materials, services 
                           and technology undertaken directly or indirectly 
                           for the purpose of supplying a military or other 
                           security establishment, 
 
                      (ii) taken in time of war or other emergency in 
                           international relations, or 
 
                      (iii)     relating to the implementation of national 
                                policies or international agreements 
                                respecting the non-proliferation of nuclear 
                                weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; 
                                or 
 
                 (c)  to prevent any Party from taking action in pursuance 
                      of its obligations under the United Nations Charter 
                      for the maintenance of international peace and 
                      security. 
 
 
            Article 2103:  Taxation 
 
            1.   Except as set out in this Article, nothing in this 
            Agreement shall apply to taxation measures. 
 
            2.   Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and 
            obligations of any Party under any tax convention.  In the 
            event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such 
            convention, that convention shall prevail to the extent of the 
            inconsistency. 
 
            3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2: 
 
                 (a)  Article 301 (Market Access - National Treatment) and 
                      such other provisions of this Agreement as are 
                      necessary to give effect to that Article shall apply 
                      to taxation measures to the same extent as does 
                      Article III of the GATT; and 
 
                 (b)  Article 314 (Market Access - Export Taxes) and 
                      Article 604 (Energy - Export Taxes) shall apply to 
                      taxation measures. 
 
            4.   Subject to paragraph 2: 
 
                 (a)  Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services - 
                      National Treatment) and Article 1405 (Financial 
                      Services - National Treatment) shall apply to 
                      taxation measures on income, capital gains or on the 
                      taxable capital of corporations, and to those taxes 
                      listed in paragraph 1 of Annex 2103.4, that relate to 
                      the purchase or consumption of particular services, 
                      and 
 
                 (b)  Articles 1102 and 1103 (Investment - National 
                      Treatment and Most-Favored Nation Treatment), 
                      Articles 1202 and 1203 (Cross-Border Trade in 
                      Services - National Treatment and Most-Favored Nation 
                      Treatment) and Articles 1405 and 1406 (Financial 
                      Services - National Treatment and Most-Favored Nation 
                      Treatment) shall apply to all taxation measures, 
                      other than those on income, capital gains or on the 
                      taxable capital of corporations, taxes on estates, 
                      inheritances, gifts and generation-skipping transfers 
                      and those taxes listed in paragraph 1 of Annex 
                      2103.4, 
 
            except that nothing in those Articles shall apply 
 
                 (c)  any most-favored-nation obligation with respect to an 
                      advantage accorded by a Party pursuant to a tax 
                      convention, 
 
                 (d)  to a non-conforming provision of any existing 
                      taxation measure, 
 
                 (e)  to the continuation or prompt renewal of a non- 
                      conforming provision of any existing taxation 
                      measure, 
 
                 (f)  to an amendment to a non-conforming provision of any 
                      existing taxation measure to the extent that the 
                      amendment does not decrease its conformity, at the 
                      time of the amendment, with any of those Articles, 
 
                 (g)  to any new taxation measure aimed at ensuring the 
                      equitable and effective imposition or collection of 
                      taxes and that does not arbitrarily discriminate 
                      between persons, goods or services of the Parties or 
                      arbitrarily nullify or impair benefits accorded under 
                      those Articles, in the sense of Annex 2004, or 
 
                 (h)  to the measures listed in paragraph 2 of Annex 
                      2103.4. 
 
            5.   Subject to paragraph 2 and without prejudice to the rights 
            and obligations of the Parties under paragraph 3, Article 
            1106(3), (4) and (5) (Investment - Performance Requirements) 
            shall apply to taxation measures. 
 
            6.   Article 1110 (Investment - Expropriation) shall apply to 
            taxation measures except that no investor may invoke that 
            Article as the basis for a claim under Article 1116 or 1117, 
            where it has been determined pursuant to this paragraph that 
            the measure is not an expropriation.  The investor shall refer 
            the issue of whether the measure is not an expropriation for a 
            determination to the appropriate competent authorities set out 
            in Annex 2103.6 at the time that it gives notice under Article 
            1119.  If the competent authorities do not agree to consider 
            the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that 
            the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six 
            months of such referral, the investor may submit its claim to 
            arbitration under Article 1120. 
 
 
            Article 2104:  Balance of Payments 
 
            1.   Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a 
            Party from adopting or maintaining measures that restrict 
            transfers where the Party experiences serious balance of 
            payments difficulties, or the threat thereof, and such 
            restrictions are consistent with paragraphs 2 through 4 and 
            are: 
 
                 (a)  consistent with paragraph 5 to the extent they are 
                      imposed on other transfers than cross-border trade in 
                      financial services; or 
 
                 (b)  consistent with paragraphs 6 and 7 to the extent they 
                      are imposed on cross-border trade in financial 
                      services.  
 
            General Rules 
 
            2.   As soon as practicable after a Party imposes a measure 
            under this Article, the Party shall: 
 
                 (a)  submit any current account exchange restrictions to 
                      the IMF for review under Article VIII of the Articles 
                      of Agreement of the IMF; 
 
                 (b)  enter into good faith consultations with the IMF on 
                      economic adjustment measures to address the 
                      fundamental underlying economic problems causing the 
                      difficulties; and  
 
                 (c)  adopt or maintain economic policies consistent with 
                      such consultations. 
 
            3.   A measure adopted or maintained under this Article shall: 
 
                 (a)  avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic 
                      or financial interests of another Party; 
 
                 (b)  not be more burdensome than necessary to deal with 
                      the balance of payments difficulties or threat 
                      thereof; 
 
                 (c)  be temporary and be phased out progressively as the 
                      balance of payments situation improves;  
 
                 (d)  be consistent with paragraph 2(c) and with the 
                      Articles of Agreement of the IMF; and 
 
                 (e)  be applied on a national treatment or 
                      most-favored-nation treatment basis, whichever is 
                      better. 
 
            4.   A Party may adopt or maintain a measure under this Article 
            that gives priority to services that are essential to its 
            economic program, provided that a Party may not impose a 
            measure for the purpose of protecting a specific industry or 
            sector unless the measure is consistent with paragraph 2(c) and 
            with Article VIII(3) of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF. 
 
            Restrictions on Transfers Other than Cross-Border Trade in 
            Financial Services 
 
            5.   Restrictions imposed on transfers, other than on cross- 
            border trade in financial services: 
 
                 (a)  where imposed on payments for current international 
                      transactions, shall be consistent with Article 
                      VIII(3) of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF; 
 
                 (b)  where imposed on international capital transactions, 
                      shall be consistent with Article VI of the Articles 
                      of Agreement of the IMF and be imposed only in 
                      conjunction with measures imposed on current 
                      international transactions under paragraph 2(a);  
 
                 (c)  where imposed on transfers covered by Article 1109 
                      (Investment - Transfers) and transfers related to 
                      trade in goods, may not substantially impede 
                      transfers from being made in a freely usable currency 
                      at a market rate of exchange; and 
 
                 (d)  may not take the form of tariff surcharges, quotas, 
                      licenses or similar measures. 
 
            Restrictions on Cross-Border Trade in Financial Services 
 
            6.   A Party imposing a restriction on cross-border trade in 
            financial services: 
 
                 (a)  may not impose more than one measure on any transfer, 
                      unless consistent with paragraph 2(c) and with 
                      Article VIII(3) of the Articles of Agreement of the 
                      IMF; and 
 
                 (b)  shall promptly notify and consult with the other 
                      Parties to assess the balance of payments situation 
                      of the Party and the measures it has adopted, taking 
                      into account among other elements 
 
                      (i)  the nature and extent of the balance of payments 
                           difficulties of the Party, 
 
                      (ii) the external economic and trading environment of 
                           the Party, and 
 
                      (iii)     alternative corrective measures that may be 
                                available. 
 
            7.   In consultations under paragraph 6(b), the Parties shall: 
 
                 (a)  consider if measures adopted under this Article 
                      comply with paragraph 3, in particular paragraph 
                      3(c); and  
 
                 (b)  accept all findings of statistical and other facts 
                      presented by the IMF relating to foreign exchange, 
                      monetary reserves and balance of payments, and shall 
                      base their conclusions on the assessment by the IMF 
                      of the balance of payments situation the Party 
                      adopting the measures. 
 
 
            Article 2105:  Disclosure of Information 
 
                 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a 
            Party to furnish or allow access to information the disclosure 
            of which would impede law enforcement or would be contrary to 
            the Party's law protecting personal privacy or the financial 
            affairs and accounts of individual customers of financial 
            institutions.

                                         NOTES 
 
 
            1.    Article 301 (Market Access - National Treatment):  "goods 
            of the Party" as used in paragraph 2 includes goods produced in 
            the state or province of that Party.  
 
            2.   Article 302(1) (Tariff Elimination):  this paragraph is 
            not intended to prevent any Party from modifying its non-NAFTA 
            tariffs on originating goods for which no NAFTA tariff 
            preference is claimed.  
 
            3.   Article 302(1) (Tariff Elimination):   this paragraph does 
            not prohibit a Party from raising a tariff back to an agreed 
            level in accordance with the NAFTA's phase-out schedule 
            following a unilateral reduction. 
 
            4.   Article 302(1) and (2) (Tariff Elimination):  paragraphs 1 
            and 2 are not intended to prevent a Party from maintaining or 
            increasing a customs duty as may be authorized by any dispute 
            settlement provision of the GATT or any agreement negotiated 
            under the GATT. 
 
            5.   Article 303 (Restriction on Drawback and Duty Deferral):  
            in applying the definition of "used" in Article 415 to this 
            Article, the definition of "consumed" in Article 318 shall not 
            apply. 
 
            6.   Article 305(2)(d) (Temporary Admission of Goods):  where 
            another form of monetary security is used, it shall not be more 
            burdensome than the bonding requirement referred to in this 
            subparagraph.  Where a Party uses a non-monetary form of 
            security, it shall not be more burdensome than existing forms 
            of security used by that Party. 
 
            7.   Article 307(1) (Market Access - Goods Re-Entered after 
            Repair or Alteration):  this paragraph does not cover goods 
            imported in bond, into foreign-trade zones or in similar 
            status, that are exported for repairs and are not re-imported 
            in bond, into foreign-trade zones or in similar status. 
 
            8.   Article 307(1) (Market Access - Goods Re-Entered after 
            Repair or Alteration):  for purposes of this paragraph, 
            alteration includes laundering used textile and apparel goods 
            and sterilizing previously sterilized textile and apparel 
            goods. 
 
            9.   Article 318 (Market Access - Definitions):  10-digit items 
            set out in the Tariff Schedule of Canada are included for 
            statistical purposes only. 
 
            10.  Article 318 (Market Access - Definitions):  with respect 
            to the definition of "repair and alteration", an operation or 
            process that is part of the production or assembly of an 
            unfinished good into a finished good is not a repair or 
            alteration of the unfinished good; a component of a good is a 
            good that may be subject to repair or alteration.  
 
            11.  Annex 300-A (Trade and Investment in the Automotive 
            Sector), Appendix 300-A.1 - Canada:  paragraphs 1 and 2 shall 
            not be construed to modify the rights and obligations set out 
            in Chapter Ten of the Canada - United States Free Trade 
            Agreement, except that the NAFTA rules of origin shall replace 
            the Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement rules of origin 
            for purposes of Article 1005(1). 
 
            12.  Annex 300-A (Trade and Investment in the Automotive 
            Sector), Appendix 300-A.2 - Mexico:  citations to the Auto 
            Decree and the Auto Decree Implementing Regulations included in 
            parentheses are provided for purposes of reference only. 
 
            13.  Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods) Section 1 (Scope 
            and Coverage):  the general provisions of Chapter Two 
            (Definitions), Chapter Three (Market Access), Chapter Four 
            (Rules of Origin) and Chapter Eight (Emergency Action) are 
            subject to the specific rules for textiles and apparel goods 
            set out in the Annex. 
 
            14.  Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods) Section 2 (Tariff 
            Elimination):  with respect to paragraph 1, "as otherwise 
            provided in this Agreement" refers to such provisions as 
            Section 4, Article 802 (Global Emergency Action) and Chapter 22 
            (General Exceptions). 
 
            15.  Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods) Sections 4 and 5 - 
            Bilateral Emergency Actions (Tariff Actions):  for purposes of 
            Sections 4 and 5: 
 
                 (a)  "increased quantities" is intended to be interpreted 
                      more broadly than the standard provided in Article 
                      801(1), which considers imports "in absolute terms" 
                      only.  For purposes of these Sections, "increased 
                      quantities" is intended to be interpreted in the same 
                      manner as this standard is interpreted in the draft 
                      Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, contained in the 
                      Draft Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay 
                      Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (GATT 
                      document MTN.TNC/W/FA) issued by the Director-General 
                      of the GATT on December 20, 1991 ("Draft Uruguay 
                      Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing"); and 
 
                 (b)  "serious damage" is intended as a less stringent 
                      standard than "serious injury" under Article 801(1).  
                      The "serious damage" standard is drawn from the Draft 
                      Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.  
                      The factors to be considered in determining whether 
                      the standard has been met are set out in Section 4.2 
                      and are also drawn from that Draft.  "Serious damage" 
                      is to be interpreted in the light of its meaning in 
                      Annex A of the Multifiber Arrangement or any 
                      successor agreement. 
 
            16.  Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods) Section 5 
            (Bilateral Emergency Actions - Quantitative Restrictions):  in 
            paragraph 5(c), the term "equitable treatment" is intended to 
            have the same meaning as it has in customary practice under the 
            Multifiber Arrangement. 
 
            17.  Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods) Section 7, 
            paragraph 1(c) (Review and Revision of Rules of Origin):  for 
            subheading 6212.10, the rule and paragraph 1 shall not be 
            applied if the Parties agree, prior to entry into force of this 
            Agreement, on measures to ease the administrative burden and 
            reduce costs associated with the application of the rule for 
            headings 62.06 through 62.11 to the apparel in subheading 
            6212.10. 
 
            18.  Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods) Section 7, 
            paragraph (2)(d)(ii) (Review and Revision of Rules of Origin):  
            with respect to provisions (a) through (i) of the rule for 
            subheadings 6205.20 through 6205.30, prior to the entry into 
            force of this Agreement the Parties will extend cooperation as 
            necessary in an effort to encourage production in the free 
            trade area of shirting fabrics specifically identified in the 
            rule. 
 
            19.  Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods), Appendix 3.1, 
            paragraph 17:  for purposes of applying paragraph 17, the 
            determination of the component that determines the tariff 
            classification of the good shall be based on GRI 3(b) of the 
            Harmonized System, and if the component cannot be determined on 
            the basis of GRI 3(b), then the determination will be based on 
            GRI 3(c) or, if GRI 3(c) is inapplicable, GRI 4.  When the 
            component that determines the tariff classification is a blend 
            of two or more yarns or fibers, all yarns and, where 
            applicable, fibers, in that component are to be considered. 
 
            20.  Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods) Schedule 3.1.3. 
            (Conversion Factors):  the conversion factors in this Schedule 
            are those used for imports into the United States.  Canada and 
            Mexico may by mutual agreement develop their own conversion 
            factors for trade between them. 
 
            21.  Article 401 (Rules of Origin - Originating Goods):  the 
            phrase "specifically describes" is intended solely to prevent 
            Article 401(d) from being used to qualify a part of another 
            part, where the heading or subheading covers the final good, 
            the part made from the other part and the other part. 
 
            22.  Article 402 (Rules of Origin - Regional Value Content): 
 
                 (a)  Article 402(4) applies to intermediate materials, and 
                      that VNM in paragraphs 2 and 3 does not include 
 
                      (i)  the value of any non-originating materials used 
                           by another producer to produce an originating 
                           material that is subsequently acquired and used 
                           in the production of the good by the producer of 
                           the good, and 
 
                      (ii) the value of non-originating materials used by 
                           the producer to produce an originating self- 
                           produced material that is designated by the 
                           producer as an intermediate material pursuant to 
                           Article 402(10);  
                 (b)  with respect to paragraph 4, where an originating 
                      intermediate material is subsequently used by the 
                      producer with non-originating materials (whether or 
                      not produced by the producer) to produce the good, 
                      the value of such non-originating materials shall be 
                      included in the VNM of the good; 
 
                 (c)  with respect to paragraph 8, sales promotion, 
                      marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, 
                      shipping and packing costs, and non-allowable 
                      interest costs included in the value of materials 
                      used in the production of the good are not subtracted 
                      out of the net cost in the calculation under Article 
                      402(3); 
 
                 (d)  with respect to paragraph 10, an intermediate 
                      material used by another producer in the production 
                      of a material that is subsequently acquired and used 
                      by the producer of the good shall not be taken into 
                      account in applying the proviso set out in that 
                      paragraph, except where two or more producers 
                      accumulate their production under Article 404; 
 
                 (e)  with respect to paragraph 10, if a producer 
                      designates a self-produced material as an originating 
                      intermediate material and the Customs Administration 
                      of the importing Party subsequently determines that 
                      the intermediate material is not originating, the 
                      producer may rescind the designation and recalculate 
                      the value content of the good accordingly; in such a 
                      case, the producer shall retain its rights of appeal 
                      or review with regard to the determination of the 
                      origin of the intermediate material; and 
 
                 (f)  under paragraph 4, with respect to any self-produced 
                      material that is not designated as an intermediate 
                      material, only the value of non-originating materials 
                      used to produce the self-produced material shall be 
                      included in VNM of the good.

                      the imported good in production or resells the

                           material any assembly, including a component 
                           identified in Annex 403.2, containing one or 
                           more of the materials listed in Annex 403.2, and

                           the production of that material as an 
                           intermediate material, in accordance with the 
                           provisions of Article 402(10). 
 
            24.  Article 405(6) (Rules of Origin - De Minimis):  for 
            purposes of applying paragraph 6, the determination of the 
            component that determines the tariff classification of the good 
            shall be based on GRI 3(b) of the Harmonized System.  If the 
            component cannot be determined on the basis of GRI 3(b), then 
            the determination will be based on GRI 3(c) or, if GRI 3(c) is 
            inapplicable, GRI 4.  When the component that determines the 
            tariff classification is a blend of two or more yarns or 
            fibers, all yarns and, where applicable, fibers, in that 
            component are to be taken into account.  
 
            25.  Article 413 (Rules of Origin - Interpretation and 
            Application):  the rules of origin under Chapter Four are based

            26.  Article 415 (Rules of Origin - Definitions):  the phrase 
            "except for the application of Article 403(1) or 403(2)(a)" in 
            the definition of "transaction value" is intended solely to 
            ensure that the determination of transaction value in the 
            context of Article 403(1) or (2)(a) shall not be limited to the 
            transaction of the producer of the good. 
 
            27.  Article 514 (Customs Procedures - Definitions):  the 
            Uniform Regulations will clarify that "determination of origin" 
            includes a denial of preferential tariff treatment under 
            Article 506(4), and that such denial is subject to review and 
            appeal.

            quota as described in Additional Note 3(b)(i) of Chapter 17 of 
            the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States prior to 
            the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 
 
            31.  Annex 703.2 (Agriculture - Market Access - Section A - 
            Mexico and the United States):  the United States operates a 
            re-export program under Additional U.S. Note 3 to Chapter 17 of 
            the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule and under 7 C.F.R. Part

            32.  Annex 703.2 (Agriculture - Market Access - Section B - 
            Canada and Mexico):  the incorporation in paragraph 6 is not 
            intended to override the exceptions to Articles 301 and 309 set 
            out in Canada's and Mexico's respective Schedules to Annex 
            301.3. 
 
            33.  Article 906(4) and (6) (Compatibility and Equivalence):  
            these paragraphs are not intended to restrict the right of the 
            importing Party to revise its measures.

                      be unreasonable to conclude that the Measures element
                      should prevail, in which case the other elements
                      shall prevail to the extent of that discrepancy.

                 (d)  Type of Reservation specifies the obligation referred 
                      to in paragraph 1 for which the reservation is taken; 
 
                 (e)  Level of Government indicates the level of government 
                      maintaining the measure for which the reservation is 
                      taken; 
 
                 (f)  Measures identifies the laws, regulations or other 
                      measures, as qualified by the Description element, 
                      for which the reservation is taken.  A measure cited 
                      in the Measures element 
 
                      (i)  means the measure as amended, continued or 
                           renewed as of the date of entry into force of 
                           this Agreement, and 
 
                      (ii) includes any subordinate measure adopted or 
                           maintained under the authority of and consistent 
                           with the measure; 
 
                 (g)  Description sets out references, if any, for 
                      liberalization on the date of entry into force of 
                      this Agreement pursuant to other sections of a 
                      Party's Schedule to this Annex, and the remaining 
                      non-conforming aspects of the existing measures for 
                      which the reservation is taken; and 
 
                 (h)  Phase-Out sets out commitments, if any, for

            3.   In the interpretation of a reservation, all elements of 
            the reservation shall be considered.  A reservation shall be 
            interpreted in the light of the relevant provisions of the 
            Chapter against which the reservation is taken.  To the extent 
            that: 
 
                 (a)  the Phase-Out element provides for the phasing out of 
                      the non-conforming aspects of measures, the Phase-Out 
                      element shall prevail over all other elements; 
 
                 (b)  the Measures element is qualified by a specific 
                      reference in the Description element, the Measures 
                      element as so qualified shall prevail over all other 
                      elements; and  
 
                 (c)  the Measures element is not so qualified, the 
                      Measures element shall prevail over all other 
                      elements, unless any discrepancy between the Measures 
                      element and the other elements considered in their 
                      totality is so substantial and material that it would 
                      be unreasonable to conclude that the Measures element 
                      should prevail, in which case the other elements 
                      shall prevail to the extent of that discrepancy. 
 
            4.   Section B of the Schedule of a Party sets out reservations 
            taken by the Party, pursuant to Article 1409(2), for measures 
            the Party may adopt or maintain that do not conform with 
            obligations imposed by Article 1403, 1404, 1405, 1406, 1407 or 
            1408. 
 
            5.   Section C of the Schedule of a Party sets out the 
            commitments to liberalize measures undertaken by that Party 
            pursuant to Article 1409(3).

                                1.   Under the Investment Canada Act, the
                                following acquisitions of Canadian businesses
                                by "non-Canadians" are subject to review by
                                Investment Canada:

                                (a)  all direct acquisitions of Canadian
                                     businesses with assets of C$5 million or
                                     more;

                                (b)  all indirect acquisitions of Canadian

                                (c)  indirect acquisitions of Canadian
                                     businesses with assets between C$5

                                     indirectly, in the transaction in

                                  Annex I - Canada




                                2.   A "non-Canadian" is an individual,
                                government or agency thereof or an entity
                                that is not "Canadian".  "Canadian" means a
                                Canadian citizen or permanent resident,
                                government in Canada or agency thereof or
                                Canadian-controlled entity as provided for in
                                the Investment Canada Act.

                                3.   In addition, specific acquisitions or
                                new businesses in designated types of
                                business activities relating to Canada's
                                cultural heritage or national identity, which
                                are normally notifiable, may be reviewed if
                                the Governor in Council authorizes a review
                                in the public interest.

                                4.   An investment subject to review under
                                the Investment Canada Act may not be
                                implemented unless the Minister responsible
                                for the Investment Canada Act advises the
                                applicant that the investment is likely to be
                                of net benefit to Canada.  Such a
                                determination is made in accordance with six
                                factors described in the Act, summarized as
                                follows:

                                (a)  the effect of the investment on the
                                     level and nature of economic activity in
                                     Canada, including the effect on
                                     employment, on the utilization of parts,
                                     components and services produced in
                                     Canada, and on exports from Canada;

                                (b)  the degree and significance of
                                     participation by Canadians in the
                                     investment;

                                (c)  the effect of the investment on
                                     productivity, industrial efficiency,
                                     technological development and product
                                     innovation in Canada;

                                (d)  the effect of the investment on
                                     competition within any industry or
                                     industries in Canada;

                                  Annex I - Canada

                                (e)  the compatibility of the investment with
                                     national industrial, economic and
                                     cultural policies, taking into
                                     consideration industrial, economic and
                                     cultural policy objectives enunciated by
                                     the government or legislature of any
                                     province likely to be significantly
                                     affected by the investment; and 

                                (f)  the contribution of the investment to
                                     Canada's ability to compete in world
                                     markets.

                                5.   In making a net benefit determination,
                                the Minister, through Investment Canada, may
                                review plans under which the applicant
                                demonstrates the net benefit to Canada of the
                                proposed acquisition.  An applicant may also
                                submit undertakings to the Minister in
                                connection with any proposed acquisition
                                which is the subject of review.  In the event
                                of noncompliance with an undertaking by an
                                applicant, the Minister may seek a court
                                order directing compliance or any other
                                remedy authorized under the Act.

                                6.   Non-Canadians who establish or acquire
                                Canadian businesses, other than those
                                described above, must notify Investment
                                Canada.

                                7.   Investment Canada will review an
                                "acquisition of control", as defined in the
                                Investment Canada Act, of a Canadian business
                                by an investor of Mexico or of the United
                                States if the value of the gross assets of
                                the Canadian business is not less than the
                                applicable threshold.

                                8.   The review threshold applicable to
                                investors of Mexico or of the United States,
                                calculated as set out in the Phase-Out
                                element, is higher than those described in
                                paragraph 1.  However, this higher review
                                threshold does not apply in the following

                                  Annex I - Canada

                                sectors: uranium production and ownership of
                                uranium producing properties; oil and gas;
                                financial services; transportation services;
                                and cultural businesses.

                                9.   Notwithstanding the definition of
                                "investor of a Party" in Article 1139, only
                                investors who are nationals, or entities
                                controlled by nationals as provided for in
                                the Investment Canada Act, of Mexico or of
                                the United States may benefit from the higher
                                review threshold.

                                10.  An indirect "acquisition of control" of
                                a Canadian business by an investor of Mexico
                                or of the United States is not reviewable.  

                                11.  Notwithstanding Article 1106(1), Canada
                                may impose requirements, or enforce any
                                commitment or undertaking, in connection with
                                the establishment, acquisition, expansion,

                                process or other proprietary knowledge to a
                                national or enterprise, affiliated to the
                                transferor, in Canada, in connection with the
                                review of an acquisition of an investment
                                under the Investment Canada Act.

                                12.  Except for requirements, commitments or
                                undertakings relating to technology transfer
                                as set out in paragraph 11, Article 1106(1)
                                shall apply to requirements, commitments or
                                undertakings imposed or enforced under the
                                Investment Canada Act.  Article 1106(1) shall
                                not be construed to apply to any requirement,
                                commitment or undertaking imposed or enforced
                                in connection with a review under the
                                Investment Canada Act, to locate production,

                                States, the applicable threshold for the
                                review of a direct acquisition of control of
                                a Canadian business will be:

                                (a)  for the 12-month period beginning on the
                                     date of entry into force of this
                                     Agreement, the monetary amount as
                                     determined in accordance with Annex
                                     1607.3 of the Canada - United States

                                     multiplied by an annual adjustment
                                     representing the increase in nominal

                                     below.

                                The calculation of the annual adjustment will
                                be determined in January of each year after
                                1994 using the most recently available data
                                published by Statistics Canada and using the

                                "Current nominal GDP at market prices" means
                                the arithmetic mean of the nominal Gross
                                Domestic Product at market prices for the
                                most recent four consecutive quarters
                                (seasonally adjusted at annual rates).

                                "Previous year nominal GDP at market prices"

                                The Act permits the Minister to impose an
                                additional requirement on the applicant, as
                                part of the benefits plan, to ensure that
                                disadvantaged individuals or groups have
                                access to training and employment

                                Implementation Act have the same requirement
                                for a benefits plan but also require that the

                                     place;

                                (b)  expenditures be made for research and

                                     or services are competitive in terms of
                                     fair market price, quality and delivery.

                                4.   The Boards administering the benefits
                                plan under these Acts may also require that
                                the plan include provisions to ensure that
                                disadvantaged individuals or groups, or
                                corporations owned or cooperatives operated
                                by them, participate in the supply of goods

                                     reserved to Canadian carriers under the
                                     National Transportation Act, 1987.

                                "Canadian" is defined in the National
                                Transportation Act, 1987 to mean a Canadian
                                citizen or permanent resident, a government
                                in Canada or agent thereof or any other
                                person or entity that is controlled in fact
                                by, and of which at least 75 percent of the
                                voting interests are owned and controlled by,
                                persons otherwise meeting these requirements.

                                Regulations made under the Aeronautics Act
                                also require that a Canadian air carrier
                                operate Canadian-registered aircraft.  To be
                                qualified to register aircraft in Canada, a
                                carrier must be a Canadian citizen or
                                permanent resident, or a corporation
                                incorporated and having its principal place
                                of business in Canada, its chief executive
                                officer and not fewer than two-thirds of its
                                directors as Canadian citizens or permanent
                                residents and not less than 75 percent of its
                                voting interest owned and controlled by
                                persons otherwise meeting these requirements.

                                In addition, all commercial air services in
                                Canada require a Canadian operating
                                certificate to ensure their safety and
                                security.  An operating certificate for the
                                provision of services restricted to Canadian
                                carriers is issued only to qualified persons.


                                A corporation incorporated in Canada but that
                                does not meet the Canadian ownership and
                                control requirements may only register a
                                private aircraft when the corporation is the
                                sole owner of the aircraft.  The regulations
                                also have the effect of limiting
                                "non-Canadian" corporations operating
                                foreign-registered private aircraft within
                                Canada to the carriage of their own
                                employees.

          date for purposes of this chart, and each succeeding anniversary 
          of the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall become 
          the next succeeding date in this chart, with the percentages 
          listed in this chart applying to each of the respective periods 
          as so adjusted.  If the date of entry into force of this 
          Agreement occurs on a date after January 1, 1994, the dates and 
          corresponding limits in this chart shall not be changed. 
 
          The individual and aggregate capital limits described in 
          paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Section shall be measured separately 
          (through separate accounting) for life and non-life insurance 
          operations, but both types of insurance operations may be 
          conducted either by a single or separate foreign financial 
          affiliates.   
 
          7.   An insurance investor of another Party may elect an 
          alternative procedure for investment in Mexico through phasing-in 
          an equity interest in a new or existing Mexican insurance 
          company, and thereby exempt such Mexican company from the capital 
 
                              Annex VII(B) - Mexico                         
  
          limits in paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Section.  In order to 
          qualify, the percentage of the Mexican insurance company's common 
          voting stock that is owned by Mexican persons must not be less 
          than the levels set forth in the chart in this paragraph for the 
          respective one-year periods beginning on each of the following 
          dates: 
 
                    Date                Mexican Interest                    
 
               January 1, 1994                 70% 
               January 1, 1995                 65% 
               January 1, 1996                 60% 
               January 1, 1997                 55% 
               January 1, 1998                 49% 
               January 1, 1999                 25% 
 
          If the date of entry into force of this Agreement occurs on a 
          date prior to January 1, 1994, that date shall become the initial 
          date for purposes of this chart, and each succeeding anniversary 
          of the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall become 
          the next succeeding date in this chart, with the percentages 
          listed in this chart applying to each of the respective periods 
          as  adjusted.  If the date of entry into force of this Agreement 
          occurs on a date after January 1, 1994, the dates and 
          corresponding limits in this chart shall nonetheless not be 
          changed. 
 
          On and after January 1, 2000 (or, if the date of entry into force 
          of this Agreement occurs on a date prior to January 1, 1994, on 
          and after the sixth anniversary of such date), the percentage 
          requirement of Mexican ownership set forth in this paragraph 
          shall no longer apply. 
 
          This paragraph is further modified by paragraph 4 of Section C of 
          this Schedule to the extent set forth therein.   
 
          8.   The aggregate assets of foreign financial affiliates that 
          are limited scope financial institutions within the meaning of 
          paragraph 2 of Section C of this Schedule shall not exceed three 
          percent of the sum of: 
 
               (a)  the aggregate assets of all commercial banks in Mexico; 
                    plus 
 
               (b)  the aggregate assets of all types of limited scope 
                    financial institutions in Mexico.   
 
                       Annex VII(B) - Mexico                                
 
          Lending by affiliates of automobile manufacturing companies with 
          respect to the manufacturers' vehicles shall not be subject to or 
          taken into account in determining compliance with this three 
          percent limit.   
 
          9.   The limits in paragraphs 2, 5, 6 and 8 of this Section shall 
          be removed at the end of the transition period.  If the sum of 
          the authorized capital of foreign financial affiliates, measured 
          as a percentage of the aggregate capital of all financial 
          institutions of such type in Mexico, reaches the percentage set 
          forth in the chart in this paragraph for such type of 
          institutions, then Mexico shall have the right, once during the 
          four years following the end of the transition period, to freeze 
          such aggregate capital percentage at its then-existing level: 
 
               Commercial banks                    25% 
               Securities firms                    30% 
 
          If applied, such a restriction will have a duration not to exceed 
          a period of three years.   
 
          10.  Mexico may deny a license to establish a foreign financial 
          affiliate during the transition period (and, in the case of 
          paragraph 9 of this Section, during the additional periods 
          described in that paragraph) if after such issuance the sum of 
          the authorized capital of all foreign financial affiliates of the 
          same type would exceed the applicable percentage limit for that 
          type of institution in paragraph 5, 6, 8 or 9 of this Section. 
 
          11.  The provisions of paragraphs 12 through 17 of this Section 
          shall apply immediately upon the date of entry into force of this 
          Agreement and at all times thereafter, except as otherwise 
          specifically provided in such paragraphs.  Any amendment or 
          modification to a measure adopted or maintained pursuant to 
          paragraphs 12 through 15 of this Section shall not decrease the 
          conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before such 
          amendment or modification, with Articles 1403 through 1408. 
 
          12.  Mexico may require that a foreign financial affiliate (other 
          than a foreign insurance affiliate) be wholly-owned by an 
          investor of another Party.  Mexico may also restrict any foreign 
          financial affiliate from establishing agencies, branches, or 
          other direct or indirect subsidiaries in the territory of any 
          other country.   
 
          13.  Following the transition period, acquisition of a commercial 
 
                               Annex VII(B) - Mexico                        

 
          bank established in Mexico, or of the assets or liabilities 
          thereof, by an investor of another Party will only be authorized 
          by Mexico, subject to reasonable prudential considerations on a 
          case-by-case basis, if the sum of the capital of the acquired 
          commercial bank and the capital of any foreign commercial bank 
          affiliate already controlled by the acquiror would not exceed 
          four percent of the aggregate capital of all commercial banks in 
          Mexico.   
 
          14.  Mexico may adopt measures that (a) limit eligibility to 
          establish a foreign financial affiliate in Mexico to an investor 
          of another Party that is, directly or through any of its 
          affiliates, engaged in the same general type of financial 
          services in the territory of the other Party; and (b) limit such 
          investor (together with its affiliates) to no more than one 
          institution of the same type in Mexico.  In determining what 
          types of operations an investor of another Party is engaged in 
          for purposes of the preceding sentence, all types of insurance 
          shall be considered to be only one type of financial service; but 
          both life and non-life insurance operations may be conducted 
          either by a single or separate foreign financial affiliates.   
 
                           Governmental Insurance Programs 
 
          Type of Reservation:     Establishment of Financial Institutions 
                                   (Articles 1403) 
                              Cross-Border Trade (Article 1404) 
                              National Treatment (Article 1405) 
 
          15.  The activities and operations of the existing Mexican 
          governmental insurance programs conducted by Aseguradora 
          Mexicana, S.A. or Aseguradora Hidalgo, S.A. (including insurance 
          for government employees, agencies, instrumentalities and public 
          entities) are excluded from Articles 1403, 1404 and 1405 for so 
          long as such firm is controlled by the Government of Mexico and 
          for a commercially reasonable time after such governmental 
          control ceases. 
 
                                  Cross-Border Trade 
 
          Type of Reservation:     Cross-Border Trade (Article 1404) 
 
          16.  In order to avoid impairment of the conduct of Mexico's 
          monetary and exchange rate policies, cross-border financial 
          service providers of another Party shall not be permitted to 
          provide financial services into the territory of Mexico or to 
 
                   Annex VII(B) - Mexico                                    
 
          residents of Mexico, and residents of Mexico may not purchase 
          financial services from cross-border financial service providers 
          of another Party, if such transactions are denominated in Mexican 
          pesos. 
 
                       Annex VII(B) - Mexico                                

 
                   Existing Operations of Foreign Commercial Banks 
 
          Type of Reservation:     Establishment of Financial Institutions 
                                   (Article 1403) 
                              National Treatment (Article 1405) 
                              Most-Favored-Nation Treatment (Article 1406) 
                              New Financial Services and Data Processing 
                              (Article 1407) 
                              Senior Management and Boards of Directors 
                              (Article 1408) 
 
          17.  The benefits of this Agreement shall not be extended to a 
          foreign bank branch existing in Mexico on the date of entry into 
          force of this Agreement.  The existing legal regime will continue 
          to apply to such a branch for so long as it operates in that 
          form.  Such a branch shall be permitted to convert to a 
          subsidiary pursuant to the terms of this Schedule, and on 
          conversion shall be covered by this Agreement.  In the event of 
          conversion the existing capital of such branch on the date of 
          signature of this Agreement shall not be counted against such 
          foreign commercial bank affiliate's individual capital limit, or 
          the aggregate capital limits for commercial banks. 
 
 
                    Annex VII(C) - Mexico                                   

                                      Section C 
 
                                 Specific Commitments 
 
 
          1.   Mexico shall retain discretion to approve, on a case-by-case 
          basis, any affiliation of a commercial bank or securities firm 
          with a commercial or industrial corporation that is established 
          in Mexico, if Mexico determines that such affiliation is harmless 
          and, in the case of banking, either (a) not substantial, or (b) 
          the financial-related activities of the commercial or industrial 
          corporation account for at least 90 percent of its annual income 
          worldwide, and the non-financial activities of such commercial or 
          industrial corporation are of a type that Mexico determines to be 
          acceptable.  Affiliation with a non-resident commercial or 
          industrial corporation that is not established in Mexico will not 
          be a reason for denial of an application to establish or acquire 
          a commercial bank or securities firm in Mexico. 
 
          2.   Non-bank investors of another Party shall be permitted to 
          establish one or more limited scope financial institutions in 
          Mexico to provide separately consumer lending, commercial 
          lending, mortgage lending or credit card services on terms no 
          less favorable than those applied to like domestic firms under 
          Mexican measures.  Mexico may permit lending services closely 
          related to the principal authorized business of a limited scope 
          financial institution to be carried out by that institution.  
          Such institutions shall be provided the opportunity to raise 
          funds in the securities market for business operations subject to 
          normal terms and conditions.  Mexico may restrict such limited 
          scope financial institutions from taking deposits. 
 
          3.   Within two years of the date of entry into force of this 
          Agreement, Mexico shall conduct a study of the desirability of 
          and, if desirable, the possible methods of establishing limited 
          scope securities firms which would have more limited powers than 
          current securities firms.  Such limited scope securities firms 
          would be subject to differing capital requirements, depending on 
          the type and extent of business conducted, that would permit 
          lower minimum capital requirements than those currently 
          applicable to Mexican securities firms.  The basis of the study 
          will be prudential considerations and opportunities for 
          investment in the securities sector.  As part of the second 
          annual meeting of the Committee required under Article 1412,  
          Mexico shall report to the other Parties on the outcome of the 
          study, including any plans for the establishment of new 
          categories of securities firms. 
 
                        Annex VII(C) - Mexico                               
           
 
          4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 7 of Section B of this Schedule, 
          an insurance investor of another Party that together with its 
          affiliates had as of July 1, 1992 an active investment or 
          ownership interest of 10 percent or more in a Mexican insurance 
          company that was specifically approved by Mexico, may:  (a) 
          exercise any contract right or option in existence as of July 1, 
          1992 with respect to ownership interests in such Mexican 
          insurance company; and (b) effective the earlier of January 1, 
          1996 or two years following the date of entry into force of this 
          Agreement, acquire a controlling interest of up to 100 percent in 
          such Mexican insurance company.  Before the effective date 
          described in clause (b) of the preceding sentence, an insurance 
          investor of another Party (together with its affiliates) 
          described in that sentence may exercise any existing contract 
          right or option described in clause (a) of that sentence, and 
          choose to expand its interest in such Mexican insurance company 
          to the extent consistent with paragraph 7 of Section B of this 
          Schedule, or maintain its existing interest.  Mexico shall 
          maintain discretion to permit acceleration of the schedule for 
          equity participation in a Mexican insurance company by an 
          insurance investor of another Party described in the first 
          sentence of this paragraph. 
 
          5.   An investor of another Party that in accordance with Section 
          B is authorized to establish or acquire, and establishes or 
          acquires, a commercial bank or securities firm in Mexico may also 
          establish a financial holding company in Mexico, and thereby 
          establish or acquire other types of financial institutions in 
          Mexico, under the terms of Mexican measures. 
 
          6.   Mexico shall administer its licensing and approval 
          procedures during the transition period in a manner that does not 
          deny the benefits of the liberalization of existing measures 
          described in its Schedule to enterprises of another Party that 
          are ultimately controlled by nationals of that Party. 
 
 
                                     Definitions

                                A license is required for any person in the

            Description:        Cross-Border Services

                                Title III of the Export Trading Company Act
                                of 1982 authorizes the Secretary of Commerce
                                to issue "certificates of review" with
                                respect to export conduct.  The Act provides
                                for the issuance of a certificate of review
                                where the Secretary determines, and the
                                Attorney General concurs, that the export
                                conduct specified in an application will not
                                have the anticompetitive effects proscribed
                                by the Act.  A certificate of review limits
                                the liability under federal and state
                                antitrust laws in engaging in the export
                                conduct certified.

                                Only a "person" as defined by the Act can
                                apply for a certificate of review.  "Person"
                                means "an individual who is a resident of the
                                United States; a partnership that is created
                                under and exists pursuant to the laws of any
                                State or of the United States; a State or
                                local government entity; a corporation,
                                whether organized as a profit or nonprofit
                                corporation, that is created under and exists
                                pursuant to the laws of any State or of the
                                United States; or any association or

                                the protection provided by a certificate of
                                review by becoming a "member" of a qualified
                                applicant.  The regulations define "member"
                                to mean "an entity (U.S. or foreign) that is
                                seeking protection under the certificate with
                                the applicant.  A member may be a partner in
                                a partnership or a joint venture; a
                                shareholder of a corporation; or a

                                With some limited exceptions, the export from
                                the United States of all commodities, and all
                                technical data, requires either a general
                                license or a validated license or other
                                authorization granted by the Office of Export
                                Licensing, U.S. Department of Commerce.  A
                                general license requires no application or
                                documentation and is generally available for

            Description:        Investment 

                                Only air carriers that are "citizens of the
                                United States" may operate aircraft in
                                domestic air service (cabotage) and may
                                provide international scheduled and non-
                                scheduled air service as U.S. air carriers.

                                U.S. citizens also have blanket authority to
                                engage in indirect air transportation
                                activities (air freight forwarding and
                                charter activities other than as actual
                                operators of the aircraft).  In order to
                                conduct such activities, non-U.S. citizens
                                must obtain authority from the Department of
                                Transportation.  Applications for such
                                authority may be rejected for reasons
                                relating to the failure of effective
                                reciprocity, or if the Department of
                                Transportation finds that it is in the public
                                interest to do so.  

                                Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, a
                                "citizen of the United States" means:  


                                (a)  an individual who is a U.S. citizen; 

                             Annex I - United States                        

                                (b)  a partnership in which each member is a
                                     U.S. citizen; or


                                (c)  a U.S. corporation of which the
                                     president and at least two-thirds of the
                                     board of directors and other managing
                                     officers are U.S. citizens, and at least
                                     75 percent of the voting interest in the
                                     corporation is owned or controlled by
                                     U.S. citizens (49 U.S.C. App.  
                                     1301(16)).

                                In addition, this statutory requirement has
                                historically been interpreted by the
                                Department of Transportation (and the Civil
                                Aeronautics Board before it) to require that
                                an air carrier in fact be under the actual
                                control of U.S. citizens.  The Department of
                                Transportation makes this determination on a
                                case-by-case basis, and has provided guidance
                                as to certain lines of demarcation.  For
                                example, total foreign equity investment of
                                up to 49 percent (with a maximum of 25
                                percent being voting stock), by itself, is
                                not construed as indicative of foreign
                                control.  See Department of Transportation

            Description:        Cross-Border Services

                                1.   Authorization from the Department of
                                Transportation is required for the provision
                                of specialty air services in the territory of
                                the United States.  A person of Canada or
                                Mexico that provides aerial construction,
                                heli-logging, aerial sightseeing, flight
                                training, aerial inspection and surveillance
                                and aerial spraying services may not be
                                authorized to provide those services if there
                                is inadequate reciprocity on the part of the
                                country of the applicant, or if approval
                                would otherwise not be in the public
                                interest. 

                                2.   A person of Mexico or Canada may obtain
                                such authorization to provide, subject to
                                compliance by that person with U.S. safety
                                regulations, aerial mapping, aerial
                                surveying, aerial photography, forest fire

                                3.   "Foreign civil aircraft" require
                                authority from the Department of
                                Transportation to conduct specialty air
                                services in the territory of the United
                                States.  "Foreign civil aircraft" are
                                aircraft of foreign registry or aircraft of
                                U.S. registry that are owned, controlled or
                                operated by persons who are not citizens or
                                permanent residents of the Unites States (14
                                C.F.R.   375.1).  Under the Federal Aviation
                                Act of 1958, a "citizen of the United States"
                                means:  

                                (a)  an individual who is a U.S. citizen;

                                (b)  a partnership in which each member is a
                                     U.S. citizen; or

                                (c)  a U.S. corporation of which the
                                     president and at least two-thirds of the

                          Annex I - United States                           

                                     board of directors and other managing
                                     officers are U.S. citizens, and at least
                                     seventy-five percent of the voting
                                     interest in the corporation is owned or
                                     controlled by U.S. citizens (49 U.S.C.
                                     App.   1301(16)).

                                In addition, this statutory requirement has
                                historically been interpreted by the
                                Department of Transportation (and the Civil
                                Aeronautics Board before it) to require that
                                an air carrier in fact be under the actual
                                control of U.S. citizens.  The Department of
                                Transportation makes this determination on a
                                case-by-case basis, and has provided guidance
                                as to certain lines of demarcation.  For
                                example, total foreign equity investment of
                                up to 49 percent (with a maximum of 25
                                percent being voting stock), by itself, is
                                not construed as indicative of foreign
                                control.  See Department of Transportation
                                Order 91-1-41, January 23, 1991.

            Description:        Cross-Border Services

                                1.   Operating authority from the Interstate
                                Commerce Commission (ICC) is required to
                                provide interstate or cross-border bus or
                                truck services in the territory of the United
                                States.  A moratorium remains in place on new
                                grants of operating authority for persons of
                                Mexico.  

                                2.   The moratorium does not apply to the
                                provision of cross-border charter or tour bus
                                services.

                                3.   Under the moratorium, persons of Mexico
                                without operating authority may operate only
                                within ICC Border Commercial Zones, for which
                                ICC operating authority is not required. 
                                Persons of Mexico providing truck services,
                                including for hire, private, and exempt
                                services, without operating authority are
                                required to obtain a certificate of
                                registration from the ICC to enter the United
                                States and operate to or from the ICC Border
                                Commercial Zones.  Persons of Mexico
                                providing bus services are not required to
                                obtain an ICC certificate of registration to
                                provide these services to or from the ICC
                                Border Commercial Zones.

                                4.   Only persons of the United States, using
                                U.S.-registered and either U.S.-built or
                                duty-paid trucks or buses, may provide truck
                                or bus service between points in the
                                territory of the United States.

                                5.   The moratorium has the effect of being
                                an investment restriction because enterprises
                                of the United States providing bus or truck
                                services that are owned or controlled by
                                persons of Mexico may not obtain ICC
                                operating authority.

                                       Annex IV  
                             Schedule of the United States 
 
 
                 The United States takes an exception to Article 1103 for 
            treatment accorded under all bilateral or multilateral 
            international agreements in force or signed prior to the date 
            of entry into force of this Agreement. 
 
                 For international agreements in force or signed after the 
            date of entry into force of this Agreement, the United States 
            takes an exception to Article 1103 for treatment accorded under 
            those agreements involving: 
 
                 (a)  aviation; 
 
                 (b)  fisheries; 
 
                 (c)  maritime matters, including salvage; or 
 
                 (d)  telecommunications transport networks and 
                      telecommunications transport services (this exception 
                      does not apply to measures covered by Chapter 
                      Thirteen (Telecommunications) or the production, sale 
                      or licensing of radio or television programming).

            development, such as those governed by the Energy Economic 
            Cooperation Program with Central America and the Caribbean

            Description:        Any person wishing to engage in

                                States and between the United States and 
                                points outside the United States must obtain 
                                a license from the Federal Communications 
                                Commission (FCC) for the use, but not the 
                                ownership, of all channels of 
                                radiocommunications.    
                                Such a license shall not be construed to 
                                create any right beyond the terms, conditions

                                and periods of the license. 
 
                                The Communications Act of 1934 requires the 
                                FCC, in granting radio station licenses, to 
                                determine if such a license would serve the 
                                public interest, convenience and necessity 
                                and empowers the FCC to impose conditions 
                                pursuant to this determination.  The FCC must
                                deny applications for radio licenses where it
                                is unable to find that such grant would serve
                                the public interest, convenience and 
                                necessity.

                                operations, including concessions, are 
                                "necessary and appropriate".  As a result of 
                                this determination, the Park Service may 
                                determine that a given concession is not 
                                needed.

                                domestic broadcast station application under 
                                section 309 of the Act.  
 
                                In addition, the term of the section 325 
                                permit shall be extended from one year to 
                                five years in all situations where it can be 
                                assured that the retransmitting station is 
                                and will be in full compliance with 
                                applicable treaties.  In assessing the public

                                interest, convenience and necessity required 
                                by the Act for the grant of authorization 
                                under section 325, the primary criterion will

                                be avoiding the creation or maintenance of 
                                electrical interference to U.S. broadcast 
                                stations that violates applicable treaty 
                                provisions.  In evaluating this and any other

                          Annex VI - United States                          
 
                                criterion permitted under section 309, the 
                                United States will ensure that the section 
                                325 process is not conducted in a manner that

                                would constitute an unnecessary restriction 
                                on trade.

          Measures:           The National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C.   72 
 
          Description:        All directors of a national bank must be 
                              citizens of the United States.  Because the 
                              president of a national bank must be a 
                              director, the president of a national bank 
                              must be a citizen of the United States.  An 
                              exception exists for a national bank 
                              affiliated with or owned by a foreign bank.  
                              Such a bank need only have U.S. citizens 
                              constitute a simple majority of the board and 
                              thus need not employ a U.S. citizen as its 
                              president. 
 
                              Two-thirds of the directors of a national 
                              bank must (a) have resided for one year prior 
                              to their election, and (b) continue to 
                              reside, in the state in which the bank is 
                              located or within 100 miles of the bank.

                              establishment of, or acquisition of an 
                              interest in, a bank subsidiary within a state 
                              ("the target state") by a foreign bank that 
                              has a full-service branch in the United 
                              States, unless the measures of the target 
                              state expressly permit such an establishment 
                              or acquisition by domestic bank holding 
                              companies with their principal place of 
                              banking operations (as that term is described 
                              under the Bank Holding Company Act) in the 
                              foreign bank's "home state" (as that term is 
                              defined in the International Banking Act).   
 
                              Federal authorities also may not approve the 
                              establishment of, or acquisition of an 
                              interest in, a bank subsidiary within a state 
                              ("the target state") by a bank holding 
                              company, including a foreign bank, that 
                              maintains its principal place of banking 
                              operations in another state, as defined under 
                              the Bank Holding Company Act, unless the 
                              measures of the target state expressly permit 
                              the establishment and acquisition by bank 
 
                      Annex VII(A) - United States                          
 
                              holding companies from the state of the 
                              company's or bank's principal place of 
                              banking operations.   
 
                              Due to these Federal measures and certain 
                              state measures, foreign banks with direct 
                              deposit-taking branches or bank subsidiaries 
                              in the United States are not permitted to 
                              establish or acquire interests in banks 
                              located in some states on the same basis as 
                              domestic bank holding companies from the 
                              state of the foreign bank's principal place 
                              of banking operations or the foreign bank's 
                              home state.  The following types of measures, 
                              among others, fall into this category:   
 
                              (a)  foreign banks are expressly excluded 
                                   from the authority to own banks under 
                                   certain regional holding company laws; 
 
                              (b)  foreign banks are implicitly excluded 
                                   from the definition of an eligible owner 
                                   under certain state laws that require a 
                                   majority of a banking company's deposits 
                                   to be in the United States, in a 
                                   particular region of the United States 
                                   or in a particular state; 
 
                              (c)  foreign banks that do not already own a 
                                   banking subsidiary in the United States 
                                   are interpreted as not qualifying as an 
                                   eligible "bank holding company" entitled 
                                   to own a bank in the United States; and 
 
                              (d)  where a foreign bank's principal place 
                                   of business is in a state which is 
                                   different from its home state and the 
                                   measures of the target state accord 
                                   better treatment to bank holding 
                                   companies from one of these states, the 
                                   foreign bank will be subject to the more 
                                   restrictive rule.
